Create your survey following our design guidelines 2. Choose your audience and buy responses 3. Watch the responses roll in and analyze your results Plan Requirements You can buy responses in countries where we offer SurveyMonkey, however accounts in certain billing countries can't buy SurveyMonkey Audience due to technical limitations. If you have data stored in our European Data Center, SurveyMonkey Audience isn't available. You can see if this applies to you by checking your Account Details . SurveyMonkey Audience orders are one-time purchases that you can make regardless of plan type. These orders aren't included in the cost of your plan subscription, and you don't need to upgrade your plan to use them. If you have the free (Basic) plan and buy responses using SurveyMonkey Audience, you get access to premium features from our paid plans . These premium features are only available on surveys you launch with Audience–if you want to use the features on additional surveys, you’ll need to upgrade your plan. When you are on a paid plan, you will have access to the paid features of that plan.

When you choose the United States as your country, you're buying responses from our Contribute or Rewards panel. When you choose a country other than the United States, you're buying responses from our global panel. Expand | Collapse Contribute and Rewards Panels SurveyMonkey Contribute panelists take surveys for charity and a chance to win a sweepstakes prize. Rewards panelists earn credits for completing surveys which they can redeem for gift cards or donate to charity. All panelists share demographic info about themselves like gender, age, and region, and other targeting attributes you might be interested in, like cell phone usage or job type. We balance Contribute and Rewards panels according to census data of age and gender. Global Panel Global panelists are managed by our trusted partners—this means respondent quality and activity must meet a satisfactory level, otherwise panelists are removed from the program. While our global panel doesn't automatically balance according to age or gender, you can target specific regions within countries and choose the distribution of responses you want from each region, age-range, and gender you select. TIP! Choose your global audience from any of these supported countries . Designing Your Survey Create your survey in SurveyMonkey and follow our SurveyMonkey Audience design guidelines to make sure your order’s a success. Demographic Information Your survey results automatically include each survey-taker's age-range, gender, and type of device used to take the survey. Plus, if you purchased Contribute or Rewards responses, we also include each survey-taker's annual household income and region. If you want additional demographic info, include questions in your survey to gather this info. You can add pre-written questions from the Demographics category in our Question Bank . Editing a Live Survey Editing the survey design after you buy responses can cause confuse survey-takers, create issues in your survey results, and may cause your order to pause. When a live survey is edited , people taking the survey looped back to the start of the survey, and their results may not match the results of your original survey. Survey Language Your survey should be in English if you're buying responses from our Contribute and Rewards panel. If you're buying a global panel, your survey should be in a supported language for the country you're targeting. For example, if you're targeting an audience in Belgium, your survey needs to be in Dutch or French. Here are some tips for creating multilingual surveys . Buying Responses If you're part of an Enterprise team , you may use Budgets to manage Audience Credits . How to Buy Responses To buy responses: After you create your survey , go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Choose Buy Responses . Select your target audience by choosing Country , Gender , Age , and Income . Click More Targeting Options to browse and choose from hundreds of other targeting options. Choose How many complete responses do you need . In the Optional settings section, toggle on any options you’d like to use with your study. These settings can improve your targeting and streamline your audience for better results.

Learn more Review Your Estimate . If there aren’t enough panelists for your order, try reducing the number of responses you need or broadening your targeting options. Click Checkout . You can pay with a credit or debit card, or Audience Credits . Once you complete your payment, we email a standard survey invitation to a random group of survey-takers who match your targeting options. It's not possible to customize the invitation email and you can't edit your order or change your targeting options after purchase. Getting More Responses To target different demographics or get additional responses, you can create multiple Target Audience collectors. Also, you can send your survey to your own list of survey-takers using other collector types, like a Web Link or Email Invitation . Excluding Duplicate Panelists Exclude any panelists who have taken surveys you've launched in the past 100 days on our Contribute and Rewards panel. Simply create a new Target Audience collector for the same survey to apply the exclusions. To prevent previous respondents from taking your current survey, toggle on the Exclusions option and select the surveys that you need excluded on the Audience calculator page . Learn more . Pricing The total cost of your order is broken down in Your Estimate on the right side of your Target Audience collector. Your Estimate includes the number of complete responses you need multiplied by the price per response. Price per response depends on: Survey length— longer surveys cost more per response since the number of questions directly correlates to length of time it takes to complete a survey and how many people complete it. Targeting options —cost for each option may increase based on how common the criteria is among our panelists. Custom Balancing Qualification rate Any applicable taxes will be added on the checkout page. Get a Quote View all our targeting options and get an estimated quote for buying responses on the Audience preview page . Your Survey Results After you purchase is completed, you can monitor the status of your order, see how many responses you have, and view your estimated completion date in the Target Audience Collector in the Collect Responses section of your survey.

There are lots of ways to analyze your data: View your survey responses Create rules to break down your results View and categorize open-ended responses Download or share your results Expand | Collapse Filtering by Demographic or Collector You can create rules to break down your results by demographic info or collector. We include demographic info as questions at the end of your survey results—filter your results by question to compare your results by demographic. Or, if you created multiple Target Audience collectors for a single survey, you can filter your results by collector. Response Status In the Individual Responses tab of your survey results, you'll find each person's response status. Status Description How you're charged Complete(Finished) Survey-takers who answered all required questions they saw, reached the end of the survey, and clicked the Done button.A survey-taker with a complete response may have skipped required questions due to logic or skipped questions that weren't required. You're charged for the number of complete responses you ordered.Occasionally, you may collect more responses than you requested—we give you those extra responses for free. Disqualified Survey-takers who answered all required questions they saw but were disqualified by logic in the survey design.Disqualified responses don't count towards the total number of complete responses you ordered, but they do count towards the number of survey-takers we send the survey to (based on your qualification rate) and they appear in your survey results. You're not charged separately for disqualified responses. When you use disqualification logic, you select a qualification rate , which affects the price per response . Incomplete (Unfinished) Survey-takers who started the survey but abandoned or left the survey on their own before completing it.Incomplete responses don't count towards the total number of complete responses you ordered, but these responses still appear in your survey results. You're not charged for incomplete responses. Paused Orders We automatically pause orders that have a higher than average abandon rate or language disparity. High abandon rate (or low response rate) means many survey-takers exit or leave your survey after starting it. If your order is paused, an Audience specialist will email the account email address with survey recommendations and give you an opportunity to make changes so you can improve your data quality. Your order may be paused if a survey is doesn't follow our design guidelines or if you edit a live survey. Complicated Matrix questions, long or unclear introductions, and consent statements can cause survey-takers to abandon a survey. Survey-takers may also abandon your survey if they feel it isn't relevant to them, so it's important you're targeting the right people . We can't reactivate an order if it's paused a second time. This is to ensure that you're receiving quality data and that our survey-takers continue to receive surveys that are relevant to them. Response Quality Beta feature : Responses Quality automation is currently available to some customers purchasing responses. Response Quality automation uses machine learning to scan your survey results, flag poor-quality responses, and delete and replace the flagged responses with new complete responses.

SurveyMonkey Can a respondent fill out the same question or page multiple times? You may need a respondent to fill out a question or page multiple times. In SurveyMonkey, you have a couple options: Turn on Multiple Responses using a Web Link Collector. You can also edit the Survey End Page to loop to the start of the survey so respondents can take the survey again, as many times as needed. Copy the question and add it to a page several times. Instruct respondents to answer as many as needed and to skip over the rest. If those options don't meet your needs, Wufoo might be right for you. Wufoo is another SurveyMonkey product that focuses on form building. Using Wufoo's multiple condition rules , you can show the appropriate number of fields to fill out based on a previous selection. This is great for registration forms . For example, ""How many kids are you signing up for camp?"" The respondent selects a number from a drop-down menu. If they choose 4, then 4 sections appear on the page to fill out.

If you're not sure, follow the instructions under ""I'm a user in an account"". I created the account If you created the Wufoo account, you can click Login from the Wufoo homepage , which takes you here: General Login Link: https://secure.wufoo.com/login/ Mobile Login Link: https://m.wufoo.com/login However, users you add to your account can't log in using that link—they have to log in using the Account Login Link, which has your account's subdomain in the URL. Account Login Link: https://subdomain.wufoo.com/login/ Mobile Account Login Link: https://m.wufoo.com/login?subdomain= YourSubdomain I'm a user in an account If you're an Admin or a User in a Wufoo account, you need to log in using the Account Login Link. To log in: Go to the general login page for desktop or mobile. In the address bar, edit the URL to replace the word ""secure"" with the account's subdomain: https:// subdomain .wufoo.com/login If you're using the mobile site, add ""?subdomain="" followed by the account's subdomain to the end of the URL: https:// m .wofuu.com/login? subdomain=YourSubdomain Enter your email address and password. How do I find the subdomain? You can see your subdomain whenever you're logged in to your Wufoo account—just look at the URL in the address bar of your browser. If you can't log in to see the subdomain, try to find the welcome email you got when you were first added to the account, which has the Account Login Link in it. Trouble Logging In Please review the following troubleshooting info. If you're still not able to log in, feel free to contact us. It helps if you can send us a link to one of your forms and if you can confirm your subdomain . I forgot my password To reset your password: Go to the forgot password page . In the address bar, edit the URL and replace the word ""secure"" with the account's subdomain : https:// subdomain .wufoo.com/login/forgot/ Enter the email address you use for the account and click Submit . Head over to your email inbox and follow the steps outlined in the email. I didn't get the password reset email First, check your spam or junk folders. If you don't see the email, it's possible that it was blocked by a filter or firewall. To make sure Wufoo emails aren't blocked: Add no-reply@wufoo.com and bounces@bounces.wufoo.com to your email's safe senders list. Allow list our info in your email account (or pass this along to your IT Team). Follow the password reset steps shown above again since emails that were previously blocked won't automatically resend. If you still don't get the email it's possible your Wufoo account is associated with a different email address. Try following the forgot password steps for other email addresses you might have used. I'm entering the right info but I can't log in If you know you're using the correct Account Login Link, email address and password, and you're still having trouble logging in, clear your browser's cache and cookies. This often does the trick. Additionally, your password expires one year after the last time you changed it — when it expires, we'll require you to reset it the next time you log in.

Survey respondents can select an answer, and we’ll automatically record their answer. We’ll also track any merge fields you included in your survey. This article uses Net Promoter Score (NPS) as an example, but you can also use multiple choice, CSAT, CES, Polar Choice (Like/Dislike), and Rating questions. For an embedded email question response to be automatically submitted, your survey must contain 1 question only. Otherwise, your respondents will need to answer any additional follow-up questions and select submit for their answers to be recorded. Building Your NPS Survey Create your survey, including any exit pages or redirects that you’d like that participant to see once the survey is completed. Because NPS is a standardized question, you can’t change the question text. To customize the question text, recreate the NPS question using the Rating question type instead. To create an NPS survey for your email: Add an NPS question. From the survey builder, select Add Question , then choose Net Promoter Score. Remove the title page from the survey. Hover over the title page and select X, then select Delete . If you keep the title page, the survey won’t be submitted when a respondent chooses their answer. Set the theme for your survey.

Forms: Overview,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/forms-overview/,"Forms: Overview | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the Form Builder? Examples of Forms How is Data Saved With a Form? Help Build Forms Forms: Overview Apply Forms: Overview What is the Form Builder? Examples of Forms How is Data Saved With a Form? Forms allow you to collect user data that will help you make decisions in your application process. Apply uses a simple form builder offering multiple question types such as multiple choice, text response, or dropdowns, as well as form logic to tailor the form to your applicant and summarize rankings. What is the Form Builder? The Form Builder is used to create and customize the forms within your site. For more information about navigating around the Form Builder, you can refer to the article: Form Builder - Overview . Within a form you can: Add a New Question Add Piping Variables Add Advanced Expression Piping Add Advanced Branching Logic Create Translations of your forms Examples of Forms Forms within your programs are completely customizable based on your needs. We've provided some examples of applicant , recommender and reviewer forms below to get you started. These examples can also be combined into a single form, if that fits your process. Examples of Applicant Forms Form Examples Descriptions Eligibility Forms Ask your applicants preliminary questions and use their responses to determine whether or not they are eligible to apply for your program(s). Personal Information Ask your applicants for basic information about themselves such as Contact Information, Mailing Address, Birthdate, etc. TIP! Use Piping Variables if you require this information to be displayed or answered in your other forms in your program workflow. This will ensure that applicants don't have to respond to the same questions multiple times. Applications Forms These are usually the core of the application process. Ask your applicants all the questions you need to that are relevant to the Program they are applying for. TIP! If you require your applicants to write an essay for the application, create a multiline Text Response question within a form to ensure that word or character limits are met. Budget Forms If your application requires your applicants to fill out a budget, create a form using Advanced Expression Piping to perform calculations within the site. Examples of Recommender Forms Form Examples = Descriptions Recommendation Forms Ask your recommenders specific questions about the applicant they are referring. TIP! Use a recommendation form as opposed to having your recommenders upload a letter to ensure that you are getting all the pertinent information you need to make an accurate decision. This will also allow you to report on the responses given by the recommenders. Examples of Reviewer Forms Form Examples Descriptions Accept/Decline Using the Simple Review stage , create a simple form to ask your reviews whether they wish for the applicant to be Accepted or Declined in the application process. Scoring Rubric Using the Advanced Review Stage , create a form to ask your reviewers to score the application based on various criteria. These forms commonly include Dropdown , Multiple Choice , or Rating Scale questions with an internal scoring setup for the choices. For more information, you can also refer to How to Set Up an Advanced Review Form Feedback Forms Ask your reviewers for comments and feedback that they wish to give the application using Text Response questions. How is Data Saved With a Form? Within SurveyMonkey Apply, we use unique identifiers to store and match up data. Every task, form, question, and choice has a unique ID that allows us to match up that question and choice to the User and the Application that gave the response. Therefore, when an applicant completes the application form within your site, their responses are stored within that form. To break that down even further, each individual response they give is stored within the questions and choices within that form. For example: The Applicant Tom Jenkins opens the ""Application Form"" and is asked the question ""What is your favorite color?"" This question gives him the options of: Choice 1: Red Choice 2: Blue Choice 3: Green Choice 4: Yellow Choice 5: Purple He selects Blue as his favorite color. Tom's response is recorded as Choice 2 , which has the label Blue. When pulling reports or piping this information into other areas of the site, we would be able to pipe in this response of Choice 2 as it has been stored within the question. Why is this Important? This information is important to know to ensure that changes in your form do not impact your data. If you are deleting questions/choices or restructuring a form then this could delete or skew your responses. For example, if the second choice in the list gets changed to Pink. Then because Choice 2 now equals Pink, Tom's response will be displayed as Pink as well. Therefore the change would result in inaccurate information. For more information in regards to this, we highly recommend referring to the article How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form to ensure that you are not making changes that will negatively affect your data.

In the Row Choices fields, enter the items you want respondents to evaluate. In the Column Choices fields, enter a label for the set of measurements you want respondents to use to evaluate the row items.

Avoid creating too many rows and columns—try not to have more than 50 answer options total. Large matrices may cause survey performance issues, and respondents may speed through the question rather than take the time to read all the answer options. Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. If you require respondents to answer a specific number or range of rows, customize the error message to reflect the requirement so respondents will know how to answer the question correctly.

Measuring Net Promoter® Score (NPS),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/programs/nps-feedback/,"Measuring Net Promoter® Score (NPS) | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Planning an NPS Survey Setting Up an NPS Survey Using Web Campaigns Using In-Page Analyzing NPS Results Help Programs Survey use cases Measuring Net Promoter® Score (NPS) GetFeedback Measuring Net Promoter® Score (NPS) Planning an NPS Survey Setting Up an NPS Survey Using Web Campaigns Using In-Page Analyzing NPS Results The Net Promoter® Score (NPS) can be used as a KPI to measure brand engagement and loyalty among your website visitors. In this article, you will learn how to easily show the NPS question to your visitors once, periodically or continuously. Learn more about NPS Planning an NPS Survey To successfully measure NPS, determine how, when, and where you wan to use your NPS question. Consider the following questions before setting up the survey: Whom do you want to ask? First off you need to identify your survey's target group. You could ask all of your website visitors, choose only existing customers or choose a more specific option, such as targeting users that are logged in. When do you want to ask? Only asking the NPS question during the ""post checkout flow"" may provide an unjustifiably high NPS. Instead, be sure to ask the question in multiple steps of the visitor journey and preferably at a point where users have been able to fully experience your website. The moment you decide to pop the question can also determine which GetFeedback tool suits your question best. How often do you want to ask? NPS is a powerful way to track engagement and brand loyalty changes among your website visitors over time. Would you like to measure your NPS score periodically or continuously to track changes over time? Is there anything else you'd like to know? You can use NPS questions in a separate survey or as part of a larger set of questions. Note that asking questions before the NPS question can bias your user and influence their response. Setting Up an NPS Survey You can use a web campaign or an in-page widget to ask your NPS question on your site. Both web campaigns and in-page widgets have a built-in NPS question type. Using Web Campaigns Web campaigns allow you to display surveys on your website. You can target specific users or show your survey at specific times using web campaigns. For example, you can target: People on specific pages People who have been on a page for a certain period of time People who have visited a certain number of pages A percentage of people on your site People with a specific browser cookie (for example, if you want to target people who have already purchased something from your site) You can also select from multiple campaign types when creating your survey, depending on when you’re showing the survey. For example, a full survey works best as an exit survey, and a slide-out survey is best if you’re targeting users on the page. When creating your survey, you can use the built-in NPS question and add an open text field, if desired. Learn more about web campaigns. Using In-Page In-page widgets allow you to embed a survey directly into your webpage. You can use the built-in NPS question, then add an open text field, if desired. After creating your in-page widget, you can add it to any webpage using the HTML we create. Learn more about in-page widgets . Analyzing NPS Results If you use our built-in NPS component, we’ll calculate and display results in your feedback dashboard. You can filter and export your results from this page. For more comprehensive analysis, go to Insights to create and view a workspace . You can analyze data in Workspaces using multiple visualizations and filters.

The exact format depends on the survey-takers' email client and the domain we're using to send the message.

PII can include a person’s full name, address, and more. Feedback buttons and data storage : You can store certain information when someone submits feedback, including an email address, location, or IP address. If you don't need this data, it's best to stop collecting it. You can turn off certain data storage in your button settings. Screenshots and PII : When someone submits feedback through a web button, we capture a screenshot of the page they left feedback on. Sometimes, this screenshot can include sensitive information, such as a respondent's account details or bank information. You can mask certain elements in screenshots or stop saving screenshots completely. Text Fields and PII : You can include open text fields in your forms and campaigns. However, respondents aren't restricted from entering personal data in these fields. To make sure this information is not sent to GetFeedback, you can mask PII sent through Text Input and Text Area fields. Open-text field masking is only available for web feedback buttons , web and app campaigns , and in-app forms. In-Page widgets are not yet supported. Before You Start You’ll need a few things to start masking personal information: A passive feedback form or active campaign with an open text field (a Text Input or a Text Area element) For web buttons and campaigns : A web developer who can implement the code on your website For app forms and campaigns : A mobile developer who can implement the code in your app GetFeedback Apps SDK 6.2.0 and above Privacy Settings for Web Forms and Screenshots Hide certain personal information from our servers and respondent screenshots, such as identities or bank details. To access your web button’s privacy settings: In app.usabilla.com , go to Buttons & Forms , then select Setup . Find your web button, then select Options > Edit Button . Scroll to the bottom and select Advanced settings . General Privacy Settings Determine what kind of data to store when someone submits feedback.

If you don't want to save additional screenshots, uncheck the box. To stop saving any screenshots, edit your feedback button and select No visual feedback . Learn more Store IP address : Save the respondent’s IP address when they submit feedback. If you store the IP address, you can find feedback sent from the same internet connection. To avoid storing this data, uncheck the box. Store user’s location : Save the respondent’s location when they submit feedback. To avoid storing this data, uncheck the box. Advanced Privacy Settings for Screenshots You can mask elements, text, and attributes in screenshots. You'll need basic HTML and CSS knowledge. There are 3 types of masking you can set up: Elements : Replace the entire element with a black box in the screenshot. Text : Show the element, but make all text in this element unreadable in the screenshot. Attributes : Remove identifiable attributes from the HTML of the screenshot. This won’t affect how the screenshot looks. Masking Individual Elements If you only have 1 element or want to define several individual elements, you can use the element ID or element selector to mask data. To use an element ID to mask elements: Get the element ID from your website: On your webpage, right-click the element, then select Inspect or Inspect Element . The web development tools display on your screen with the element highlighted. Copy the ID. In this example, the element ID is home-block_howto . In your button’s Advanced settings, enter a # , then paste the element ID in the fields based on the type of masking you want. If the element you want to mask doesn’t have a specified ID, you can use the selector instead. To use the selector: Copy the selector from your site: On your webpage, right click the element, then select Inspect or Inspect Element . The web development tools display on your screen with the element highlighted. In the development tools, right-click the highlighted element, then select Copy > Copy selector . In your button’s Advanced settings, paste the selector in the fields based on the type of masking you want. Don’t add a # or any other symbols to the selector after pasting it in the fields. Masking Several Elements by Class If you have several elements under the same class name, define masking for all of them by using the class name. In your button’s Advanced settings, enter a full stop ( . ), then paste the class name. Masking Text Fields (Web Buttons) To use the Data Masking feature in GetFeedback for Web, you'll need to enable it with a JavaScript command. The easiest way to do this is by adding the setDataMasking JavaScript command below to your Button Code. window.usabilla_live(""setDataMasking""); Advanced Field Masking: The Regular Expression (RegEx) Regular Expression (RegEx) : A sequence of characters that define a search pattern. This pattern is used to find specific keywords, numbers, or other characters in an input field. Mask personally identifiable information (PII) in open text fields, by including a set of regexes. By default, GetFeedback for Web provides you with regexes for email addresses and numbers with 4 digits or more. You can add custom regex as well. Web Forms: Using RegEx to Mask Text Fields To use data masking with regular expressions, create a JS snippet with a variable called masks containing an array of regex patterns. Then, set the array as an argument to the setDataMasking command. When the DataMasking feature finds a match, the matching data will be masked with 'X's. This masking happens in the visitor’s browser before that data is sent to the server. This ensures PII data is not transmitted with the feedback you collect. RegEx Code for Web Here is an example of how to use RegEx expressions for data masking. This example shows how to mask Dutch zip codes that have 4 numbers and 2 letters. View raw code here. App Forms: Using RegEx to Mask Text Fields This RegEx will mask any matched content in open text fields in your forms and campaigns. By default, the GetFeedback App SDK provides you with RegExes for email addresses and numbers with 4 digits and more. You can include your own RegEx as well. For example, you can create a RegEx to mask Dutch zip codes that consist of 4 numbers and two letters. Once you create your custom RegEx, implement it in the SDK.

How to Convert a Floating Point to an Integer (INT),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/convert-to-int/,"How to Convert a Floating Point to an Integer (INT) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the INT Function? Proper Formatting for INT Expressions Help Advanced Features How to Convert a Floating Point to an Integer (INT) Apply How to Convert a Floating Point to an Integer (INT) What is the INT Function? Proper Formatting for INT Expressions Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. This article will explain the process of using the INT function to convert a floating point to an integer. What is the INT Function? The INT function allows the expression to convert a floating point into an integer for either a single value or a list of values from a number of given fields. For example, if a value results in 1.0 we can use INT to convert it to 1. Converting the value into an integer would allow the value to be used within a text response field using text field validations such as currency or integers (Positive Numbers). Proper Formatting for INT Expressions The setup and formatting of the INT expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the INT expression should be set up as follows: {{ INT(variable1+variable2) }} Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of INT and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive. Always close each INT operation with brackets ( ) What's different about INT over some of the other functions is that INT can be used in conjunction with other functions. For example, using the AVG Function, if we want to calculate the average of 3 values, should that value return a floating point, INT can be used to ensure the value is a whole number. INT using addition {{ INT(q1[0]+q1[1]) }} Ensures that the sum of q1[0] and q1[1] displays a whole number. INT using subtraction {{ INT(q2[1]-q1[0]) }} Ensures that the difference of q2[1] and q1[0] displays a whole number. INT using multiplication {{ INT(q1[1]*2) }} OR(( INT(q1[2]*q2[0]) }} Ensures the product of the multiplied values displays a whole number. INT using division {{ INT(q1[3]/4) }} OR{{ INT(q2[0]/q1[1]) }} Ensures the quotient of the divided values displays a whole number. INT on another function {{ INT(SUM(q1[:0])) }} OR{{ INT(AVG(q1[0],q1[2],[q1[3]) }} Ensure the result of the expression using another function displays a whole number. INT will not round the value to the nearest whole number, it will simply remove the floating point from the value, therefore 1.6 will become 1.

CAS: How to Prepare,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/cas-how-to/,"CAS: How to Prepare | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article CAS: Overview How it works: Help Advanced Features CAS: How to Prepare Apply CAS: How to Prepare CAS: Overview How it works: CAS: Overview Single Sign-On (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. In the context of Apply, SSO implementation allows clients to leverage their existing user authentication framework to permit and provision access to a Apply site. By the end of this document you will know how to set up such an integration using CAS protocol. Who Should Read This? This document was created to assist SurveyMonkey Apply clients, SurveyMonkey Apply Implementation Specialists, and SurveyMonkey Apply Support Staff in setting up a CAS SSO integration with Apply. How CAS works with SurveyMonkey Apply: There are 4 key entities to the SSO integration: User who signs in Identity Provider Application SSO Protocol The user The user is an applicant or reviewer, who is trying to login and access Apply. Service Provider Is responsible for housing and validating a user’s sign-on credentials, as well as passing the approval notification to the authorized applications. It has a few main purposes: Provides unique identifiers (UID) for users looking to interact with a system or software. Emits other user account information (attributes), as allowed by the the third party, along with any other account metadata necessary for the integration to Apply. Provisioning user account access Apply. Establishing a “Trust” with Apply. Application The Application is the software or system, in this case Apply, establishing a trust relationship with an service provider and requesting user account provisioning from that service provider. It is also responsible for consuming information (attributes) that may be passed from the service provider SSO Protocol The protocol is what facilitates the integration between the service provider and the Application. It defines the handshake (sequence of events/data passing) for the integration. How it works: SSO works by creating an integration between a client's service provider and Apply via the CAS protocol. The handshake passes along key user information, including the UID. The key role of the service provider is to verify, for Apply, that the users information is known, and correct account details have been provided. With CAS integration there is a direct connection created between Apply and the service provider. When configuring the CAS integration with Apply, site administrators enter their CAS Service Provider URL into Apply. This URL is used to automatically redirect users to a CAS login server. Once the user inputs their credentials an authentication token/ticket is provided back to Apply approving the user's login to the Apply site. This ticket that is passed from the CAS login server contains some key user information such as the Unique ID. Once Apply has received the user’s information, it proceeds to create an account for that user, if one does not already exist inside of Apply. If a user account in Apply already exists, Apply will match the user signing in to the already existing account using the email address that has been passed along from the service provider. SSO integration using the CAS protocol can only be initiated by Apply, it cannot be initiated from the IdP. Apply’s CAS integration currently supports CAS 3.0 and up. Due to the technical nature of implementing an SSO Integration, and the vast number of authentication services that clients can have, Apply requires there to be a technical expert on the client’s end who has a background or strong knowledge of SSO.

Log in Sign up free Single Sign-On (SSO) lets everyone on your Enterprise team log in to SurveyMonkey using your organization’s corporate login credentials. SSO removes the need to maintain a separate SurveyMonkey username and password. Your organization can control who can access your SurveyMonkey team and create authentication policies for increased security. SurveyMonkey’s SSO solution follows the S​AML 2.0 specification and is Service Provider (SP) initiated. SSO glossary Term Description Service Provider (SP) A vendor that provides services to your organization. In relation to SSO, the SP is SurveyMonkey. Identity Provider (IdP) A company that provides user authentication services. IdPs manage whether an employee can access a SP, like SurveyMonkey or other applications. Okta and ADFS are common IdPs. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) The language the IdP and SP communicate in. SurveyMonkey follows the SAML 2.0 technical specifications to exchange info with your organization's IdP. Attributes Pieces of info about an employee that an IdP uses for authentication. SurveyMonkey requires 4 attributes—FirstName, LastName, Email, and NameID. Claim Types Pieces of info about a user on a team that SurveyMonkey accepts. Attributes from your IdP need to be mapped to SurveyMonkey claims so SSO works correctly. Assertion An assertion is made up of one or more statements. SurveyMonkey requires certain attribute statements in our assertions. Setting Up SSO After your organization upgrades to an Enterprise plan, you'll be given the option to set up SSO for your team's account—only 1 IdP per Enterprise team. We'll then contact your team’s Primary Admin to start the setup process and connect with your IT department. We recommend waiting to invite people to your Enterprise team until SurveyMonkey confirms that SSO is set up properly. TIP! If you already have an Enterprise plan, reach out to your CSM to get set up with SSO. Here's a high-level breakdown of what to expect when setting up SSO: Input and map metadata Your unique SurveyMonkey metadata (Entity ID and ACS URL) is provided to you by your Technical Solutions Manager. Mapping guide Example IdP attributes Claim types SurveyMonkey accepts Mapping Unique, non-changing identifier (e.g. UPN or employee ID) NameID Required Email, emailaddress Email Required FirstName, first.name, givenname, Given-Name FirstName Required Surname LastName Required Department, DepartmentID, department name Department Optional* CostCenter, cost center number CostCenterCode Optional* * Optional attributes can help you track and monitor team activity in the User Report . Send us your metadata Send SurveyMonkey your organization's metadata URL. If you’re unable to send the metadata URL, provide the XML file. We'll set up SSO in our system and send you steps to validate that it's working correctly. We need the following from you: Entity ID HTTP Redirect Endpoint X.509 Certificate (specifically the Signing KeyType) SurveyMonkey will set up SSO in our system and send you steps to validate that it's working correctly. Invite employees to access SurveyMonkey If you want to restrict some employees from accessing your team, you can use a security group to permit or deny claims on the IdP side. Primary Admins and Admins can always see how many Empty seats are available on their team from the Team Summary . When you’re ready, click Add Users from the top navigation bar and then Copy link to share with people you want to invite. Users will be able to create or convert an account to log in with SSO. Check if a user has SSO enabled After your organization sets up SSO, Admins can see whether or not a user has SSO enabled on their Survey Monkey account. Go to My Team and select Manage Users . Search for the person by entering their email. The SSO column will show a key icon next to the user’s email if SSO is enabled. If they don’t have SSO enabled, it could be for a few different reasons. Connect with your Customer Success Manager to learn more.

Branding Your Surveys SurveyMonkey Enterprise offers powerful tools to help your organization create branded surveys that reflect your identity and build trust with respondents. Consistent branding ensures a professional appearance, aligns with your organization's standards, and enhances respondent engagement. Explore the branding options available and learn how to customize your surveys effectively. Setting Up a Survey Theme What is a Survey Theme? TIP! Add your custom theme to the library and save commonly used themes as templates to create consistency across all team surveys. A survey theme determines the overall look and feel of your survey, including the font, colors, and logo placement. Custom themes are a great way to reinforce your brand identity across all surveys. To add a custom theme: Navigate to the Design Survey section of your project. Click on Themes in the left-hand menu. Select an existing theme or click Create New Theme to start customizing. Customize the following elements: Font Style and Size : Choose from available fonts or upload a custom one. Color Palette : Set primary and secondary colors for backgrounds, text, and buttons. Logo : Upload your organization’s logo and place it in the header or footer. Save the theme and apply it to your survey. Adding Your Logo Adding a logo to your survey is an easy way to make it instantly recognizable. To add a logo: Go to the Design Survey section. In the Builder tab, click Header or Footer to edit these sections. Click the Logo option to upload an image. Adjust the size and alignment as needed. Preview your survey to ensure the logo appears as intended. Supported image formats include JPG, PNG, and GIF, with a maximum file size of 2MB. Customizing Colors SurveyMonkey allows you to customize the color palette to match your brand’s identity. You can adjust background, text, and button colors. To customize brand colors: In the Themes menu, select a theme to edit. Choose your preferred colors for the following elements: Background Text Buttons Hyperlinks Save your changes and apply the theme. You can your organization’s HEX color codes for precise alignment with your brand standards. TIP! Use CSS to style your survey so that it matches your visual assets, fonts, colors, and style preferences. Adding a Custom URL A custom URL (e.g., surveys.yourcompany.com) adds another layer of professionalism to your surveys. To set up a custom URL: Connect with your SurveyMonkey Technical Contact to get started. Don’t know who your contact is? Reach out to your Onboarding Specialist ! Work with your IT team to configure the domain settings. Once set up, share the branded URL with your team for use in surveys. You can also change the subdomain of your survey link to make you organization more recognizable to respondents. ENTERPRISE ADD-ON: Requesting a custom subdomain is only available on some Enterprise packages, please contact your Onboarding Specialist to get set up. Customizing the Survey Footer The footer is another opportunity to include branding elements such as a logo, copyright notice, or links to privacy policies. First hide the SurveyMonkey footer: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Click Style . In the Settings tab, click Footer . Select None to hide the footer. Then add your own footer: You'll need to add additional text into your survey, at the very end of each page. You can add extra spacing to the top of the text so it appears lower down the page. Branding Best Practices TIP! Set a default logo or theme, or presentation template for your Enterprise team. Keep it simple Avoid overwhelming your survey with too many design elements. Consistency is key Use the same logo, fonts, and colors across all surveys. Test before sending Make sure your branding displays correctly on different devices and browsers. Align with company policies Follow your organization's branding and privacy guidelines.

For example, if you set a limit of 50 entries, receive 50 entries, and then delete 2 of them—your form will be able to accept 2 more entries. If you were to delete all 50 entries, your form would be able to accept 50 more entries. To turn off your form after a certain amount of entries: Log in and go to Forms . Click the form you want to edit. Click the Form Settings tab. Find the Turn Form Off After ____ Entries option in the Limit Form Activity section. In the textbox, enter the maximum number of entries you want the form to accept. Click Save Form . TIP! Apply Max Quantities to an Individual Field On the field level, you can limit how many times a specific answer choice can be selected.

Help Build Tasks Verify Charity Status Task Apply Verify Charity Status Task How to Create a Verify Charity Status Task Task Settings What Happens Next? The ""Verify Charity Status"" task allows you to ask your applicants to provide verification of their charity using either the 501(c)3 number generated by the IRS or from the CRA as a CRA Registered Charity . This article will outline how to add a Verify Charity Status Task, the basic settings of the task, and what happens on the user's end with interacting with the task.

Deadline Set a deadline on your task. Decide if you wish to prevent applicants from completing the task after a certain date. Prevent Editing Enabling this setting will mean that applicants will not be able to edit the task once they have fully completed it. Prerequisites The tasks you set as Prerequisites will need to be completed in the site before this task becomes available. A common example of this is if you wish to force your applicants to complete a Basic Information form task before another task becomes available. TIP! Select ""Hide task until prerequisites are met"" if you wish to make it clear to your applicants that they need to complete the prerequisite first. Set who can edit this task Determine who this task is to be edited by: - Applicants & Collaborators - Applicants Only - Collaborators Only Applicants refer to the owner/ creator of the application and Collaborators refers to any additional users added as members to the application.

The 501(c)3 or the CRA Registered Charity list are lists set up by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), respectively, to compile a list of charities and organizations that are tax-exempt. SurveyMonkey Apply uses these compiled lists to allow you as an administrator to verify an applicant's charity or organization during the application process. What it looks like to the Applicant When the applicant logs into their application they will be able to see the Verify Charity Status task within their application. They can select ""Start"" to begin the task where they will then be asked for their verification numbers: 501(c)3: 9 digit - Employer Identification Number (EIN) CRA Registered Charity: 15 characters (containing 2 letters) - CRA Business Number (BN) Once they have selected ""Verify,"" SM Apply will check their EIN/BN against that of the associated database in order to confirm. We will also be able to pull in basic information about the charity including: EIN or BN Number Company Name City State/Province Country NOTE: If the charity is not verified by SM Apply, we would recommend ensuring that the number was entered correctly within the applicant task and that the number exists within the appropriate list.

Teams,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/teams/,"Teams | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview How Teams Work Signing Up for a Team Joining a Team Managing a Team Help Teams & Enterprise Teams SurveyMonkey Teams Video Overview How Teams Work Signing Up for a Team Joining a Team Managing a Team SurveyMonkey Teams are perfect for organizations where multiple people need to work on surveys. Teams offer collaboration features that make working with other people to create, send, and analyze surveys easier than ever. Video Overview How Teams Work Here are some important facts to know about teams: A team is made up of multiple SurveyMonkey accounts. Every account has its own username and password. The Primary Admin creates the team, manages all the team’s accounts (which we call seats), and takes care of the billing for the entire team. Common Questions Expand | Collapse Can you see each other's surveys? Your surveys are private to your account unless you choose to share them with others or your Team Sharing settings automatically share all new surveys with your team. While Primary Admins manage the accounts on their team, they aren't able to see the surveys within accounts, unless they take over that seat . But they may be able to control how surveys are shared among the team. How much does it cost to add a seat? I’m a Primary Admin Go to My Team and refer to the number of Seats Available (Empty seats). If you still have seats available, it doesn’t cost anything to add someone to your team. If you don’t have any seats available, you can either reassign a seat at no cost or add a seat for an additional cost. To see how much adding a seat costs, go to Add Users and select Add Seats . Before paying, you can see the cost per seat per year, along with your overage total. We prorate the cost based on the number of days left in your billing cycle. For example, if your next renewal date is in about 6 months, your cost is only about one half of the annual price. I’m not a Primary Admin Go to our Plans and Pricing and review our team plan options. Team plans start at 3 users, and you can add more users during checkout. The cost per user is clearly broken down on the checkout page before you submit payment. Can my account belong to more than one team? If you need to work with another team, you can create another account, or try collaboration features like commenting or shared data pages . Signing Up for a Team Paid Feature: Contributor seats are currently only available on some teams. Team plans require a minimum of 3 Full Access seats. (Full Access seats were previously called Users.) The person who creates the team is the Primary Admin. They're responsible for making payments for the team and managing seats. To sign up for a team: Log in and go to our Plans & Pricing page. Review our team plans under the Team Plans tab and Select a plan. Enter your Billing Details and Payment Method . Or, move to the next step if you're upgrading your current subscription. Under Review Order , choose the number of Full Access and Contributor seats your team needs. Once your payment is processed, you can set up your team, invite people to join, and manage seats on your team . What are Full Access and Contributor seats? We offer different seat types to help you customize your team to support the way you work. Joining a Team Getting Invited If you want to join a team, you may be able to browse for teams that share your company domain or you can ask the Primary Admin to invite you. You may need to ask around at your organization who is in charge of SurveyMonkey. Learn more: Inviting and Managing Users You'll get an email when someone invites you to join their team. Pay attention to the seat type you have. Full Access Seat If you’re invited to a Full Access seat , you can choose to: Create a new account and start with no surveys. Convert an existing SurveyMonkey account to move the surveys into the team. Learn more below. Expand | Collapse Converting Your Existing Account When you convert an existing account to a team: - If the plan level of the team you're joining is different than your existing account, your account will be converted to the new plan type (and whatever features are available on that plan). - All of your surveys will remain in your account. - If you’re on an existing paid plan, you won’t receive a refund for any time remaining on the plan. However, the Primary Admin of the team will take care of future billing for your team. - Your seat and role on a team control what permissions you have within your account. - Who we regard as the owner of the account and data may change. Learn more: Your SurveyMonkey Data Joining a HIPAA-Enabled Team A HIPAA-enabled team is a team that’s been enabled with HIPAA-compliant features. If you’re invited to join an Enterprise HIPAA Team and join it by converting your existing SurveyMonkey account, your account will be HIPAA-enabled and become subject to the terms of the business associate agreement (BAA) that cover that team. This means that control of your account will be subject to your organization, and you won't be able to convert your HIPAA-enabled account back into a non-HIPAA account or leave the team. If you prefer to keep your existing account separate, you can join the HIPAA Team by creating a new SurveyMonkey account.

How to Test your SM Apply Site,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/faqs/test-apply-site/,"How to Test your SM Apply Site | Apply Help Log in Apply Help FAQs and Troubleshooting Troubleshooting Guides How to Test your SM Apply Site Apply How to Test your SM Apply Site Testing your site is a crucial step in ensuring that all aspects are working as you desired them to be. With many customized and automated processes, the system will work as it is configured to, therefore this article will walk through the different ways in which you can test different sections of the site prior to launch. Adding a Test User When testing your site, it is extremely helpful to have email accounts that you can use to test various processes in your site. Adding a Use r The process of adding a test user is the same as adding a live user to the site. In order to add a new user: Go to Manage Users Click on Add User in the top right corner Enter the First Name , Last Name , and Email Address of the user you wish to add Select the Role(s) you wish to add the user to in order to test. For example, if testing the Application process, you will want to add the user as an Applicant. DO NOT select Notify user by email that they have been added Optional: Enter applicable Role Custom Fields Click Add User Using Gmail Spoofing to Add Test User s Within SurveyMonkey Apply, you can make use of Gmail's ability to spoof an email address. This process will allow you to set up multiple accounts within the site which appear to have different email addresses, however if an email is sent from the site it will be sent to the real email. The way this works is, if your normal email is example@gmail.com you can create as many accounts as you need to under this email by adding a + and additional text after the initial part of the email. For example: example +test1 @gmail.com example +applicant @gmail.com example +100 @gmail.com This can be useful in testing how an email will be displayed when received and when in the process certain emails will be sent. See the Testing Emails section below for more details on this process. NOTE: The value that goes after the + can be anything you need it to be as long as the characters adhere to a regular email format. Testing the Application Process Once you have added a user as an Applicant to the site you can use this applicant to test the application process. Testing the Submission Process In order to test the submission process with applicant permissions: Assume the Role of the Applicant Create a new application for that user Navigate through the application process by completing the tasks in the application stage(s) as if you were an applicant applying to that application. Be sure to complete all tasks including application forms, uploads, recommender invites, etc. This may help make the process of troubleshooting live applicant issues easier. Once you have completed all the tasks, submit your test application . Testing the Recommendation Task If your application includes a recommendation task, you may wish to test this process. Assume the Role of the test Applicant Within the created application Start the recommender task Send the invite to your own email address using a different email address you have access to, or the Gmail spoofing steps detailed above. Login as the test recommender or Assume the Role of the recommender. Test declining and accepting the recommendation. After you accept the recommendation, complete the form or upload task. Submit the recommendation. Check in the Admin Application Preview to see the completed recommendation appear. NOTE: Ensure that the setting ""Allow applicants to see completed recommendations"" is set up correctly. If enabled, you will be able to see the recommendation when assuming the role of the applicant. If not enabled, it will only be visible within the Admin Application Preview. Testing the application process will allow you to ensure that all active automations and piping variables in your forms are working. You can also refer to the specific sections below for more information on how to test each feature. Adding a user and a test application will be consistently referred to throughout the various sections of this article. Testing the Review Process After testing the application process, you can move these applications to the Review Stage in order to test the review process. To test the review process: Add a User as a Reviewer Assign the application(s) to the Reviewer. If the applications are not assigned to the reviewer using one of the available methods, the applications will not be visible to the reviewer in their reviewer panel. Assume the role of the Reviewer Refer to our article on the Understanding the Reviewer Portal for instructions to complete a review on the site. Navigate through the review process to complete reviews for your test applications. Try testing the review form, making notes on applications, downloading reviews and applications etc. This will also allow you to gain a better understanding of the process when it comes to troubleshooting live reviewer issues. Testing the review process will allow you to ensure that all active automations and piping variables in your forms are working correctly for you. You can also refer to the specific sections below for more information on how to test each feature. Testing Automations When you have created an automation in the site it is important to test its functionality to ensure that the automation is correct. This is especially important for when you have conditions on your automations and want to ensure that it fires for the correct applications, and doesn't fire for applications that don't meet your conditions. In order to test your automation Create a test application that matches all of your applicable conditions of the automation Ensure that your automation is Active Using the test application, activate your automation . For example, if the automation is triggered by completing a form, use your test application to complete that form. Check to see if the action has occurred. Testing Emails Using the Send Test butto n When creating emails whether through Manage Users, Manage Applications, or Notifications there is the ability to Send a Test. This feature will allow you to enter in an email and test the format and deliverability of the emails when being received. For example, if you have a logo uploaded to the Design section of the Email settings you will be able to see how it appears within the received email. This test email will display the general template of the email, but it will not be personalized to the user receiving it. Therefore, if you have piping variables within the email these would not be sent when clicking Send Test instead they would be shown as a placeholder. Using a Test User/ Application (Recommended ) As mentioned above the Send Test button will not pipe in variables into the received emails, therefore if you are looking to test these variables you will need to send the email to a user/ application that those variables apply to. For example, if you are looking to pipe in a response from an applicant form, you will need to ensure that the test application you are using has completed that response. This process is where Gmail Spoofing can come in handy. You can use a spoofed account to create an application, and then send the email to that account containing your piped variables. The email that is sent will be received to your real Gmail address and you will be able to see how the variables appear including any formatting and design that you have applied. Testing Forms Using the Form Previe w During the build process of a form you have the ability to Preview it within the Form Builder. This will allow you to see the form as an applicant would. It will also allow you to test any validation , advanced expression piping , in-form piping , or branching logic that has been created within the form in order to ensure that the correct questions are showing when they should be. However, if you are looking to test piping variables within the form, such as pulling in the applicant's name, or a response to a question in a different form, you will not be able to test this within the Form Preview. This will need to be tested using a Test Application. Using a Test Applicatio n Although the Form Preview has a lot of capabilities for testing the form, you will not be able to test form-to-form piping variables, or piping specific to the applicant as a real user with this information will need to be used. In order to test piping variables in this manner, we would recommend using a Test Application. Using a test application will allow you to test Piping Variables, as well as everything that can be tested within the Form Preview. Testing a Program without making it Public It is quite common to need to test a program in your site including the application process, review process, automations, etc. However, you may not be ready to make it visible to applicants. If this is the case, you can take the following steps: Start by Launching your Program When launching your program, ensure that Program will be visible to applicants is not selected. Go to the Applications list for that program Click Create Application in the top right corner Enter the email address of your test user When you assume the role or log in as that user, the application will be available under My Applications and you will be able to use it to test in the site. However, the Program will remain hidden and applications can't be created by applicants.

Tealium Integration,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/integrations/tealium-integration/,"Tealium Integration | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Adding the Tag Setting Up the Tag Adding Rules Help Integrations Use your own channel Tealium Integration GetFeedback Tealium Integration Adding the Tag Setting Up the Tag Adding Rules You can easily implement a GetFeedback button through Tealium to add load rules for each Button. For example, you can use rules to load a specific GetFeedback button for mobile users. Adding the Tag In Tealium, add a new tag . In the Tag Marketplace, search for the Usabilla tag and add it. When you add the tag, you’ll be prompted with the Tag Setup window. Setting Up the Tag When completing the Tag Setup: Give your tag a descriptive name. For example, if you're adding a GetFeedback Digital Button for Desktop users, a good title would be 'Usabilla Desktop Button'. In GetFeedback , copy your web button ID: Select Setup under Buttons & Forms . Find your web button, then select Show Javascript code . Copy the Button ID (it’s the part after //w.usabilla.com in the button code). In Tealium Tag Setup, paste the Button ID in the Account ID field. Select Next to go to the Load Rules page. Adding Rules By default, the button you added will be shown on all pages. However, if you’d like to show different buttons on mobile and desktop, create a Load Rule . For example, to show this button on desktop only, create a rule that only shows this tag when the browser width is larger than 500px. You can repeat the steps above to add other buttons, that fire on different load rules. For example, you can add a GetFeedback Mobile Feedback Button that uses a load rule “Browser Width is less than 500.” When you’re ready, publish the tags to your testing or production environment.

You can also manually add multiple contacts by typing or copy and pasting in contact info. Create a spreadsheet with your contacts' email, phone number, name, and custom data in an application like Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets, then save it as a CSV file. (Phone number only displays if Text Message is enabled for your team.) (Optional): Check the box to Add to a Group . Select an existing group, or click New Group , name it, and click Add Group . Existing Contacts To add or edit custom data for a single existing contact, click the contact's row in Contacts and click Edit custom data .

Example Message with Custom Data Here’s an example of a message using custom data tags ( bolded ): Hi [FirstName] , We're planning a picnic for the [CustomData1] department and would love to get your feedback. Please do not forward this message since it's associated with your email address: [Email] Thanks for your participation! - Annie Each contact gets the message with their own custom data in place of the custom data tags. Here’s an example of what a contact sees (custom data is bolded ): Hi Danny , We're planning a picnic for the customer service department and would love to get your feedback. Please do not forward this message since it's associated with your email address: danny@surveymonkey.com Thanks for your participation! - Annie TIP! When you send a test email , custom data is pulled from a random contact in your collector. Tracking Recipient Custom Data Once your Email invitation is sent, your recipient's custom data is viewable in your collector's Recipients tab. The metadata that displays is reflective of the current custom data stored in Contacts, which may be different from the custom data that was set at the time you sent your email invitation. Custom Data in Analyze When you view Individual Responses or Responses Data exports , you can see the following custom data: Email address First name Last name Custom 1 To view all Custom Data fields, you can export your results as an XLS spreadsheet . You can apply analyze rules to filter survey data based on custom data to help you better understand why people answered the way they did. If you don't see custom data in your results, it's likely because: The survey wasn't sent via Email Invitation or Text Message collector Custom data was added to Contacts after the survey taker completed your survey Anonymous Responses was set to exclude all respondent information Custom data fields 7-50 will show in columns after your responses Related Articles Language Codes Sending Multilingual Surveys by Email Invitation Matrix Answers Disappear or Deselect Automatically English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Introduction to SurveyMonkey Apply: Monitor Mode,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/getting-started/intro-monitor-mode/,"Introduction to SurveyMonkey Apply: Monitor Mode | Apply Help Log in Apply Help Getting Started Introduction to SurveyMonkey Apply: Monitor Mode Apply Introduction to SurveyMonkey Apply: Monitor Mode A program enters Monitor Mode immediately after launch. If a change does need to be made you can always toggle back to edit mode, but we do recommend against making significant changes once your program is live as it may disrupt the application process, result in data loss, and/or impact your reporting. This article is an overview of the various actions and features available to you while monitoring your programs. How to Add Users Manually Add a User Without Sending an Invite Manually Adding Users will allow you to add the users name, email, and role all at once. The difference between this option and the Invitation Option detailed below is that an email will not be sent to the user advising them that they have been added to a site. This becomes an extra step that will need to be taken. This can be handy if you wish to complete the process of adding the users but you do not wish to send them an email quite yet. In order to add a user to the site without notifying them: Click on the Manage Users icon in the top right corner of your screen Click on Add User in the top right corner Enter the First Name , Last Name , and Email Address of the user you wish to add Select the Role(s) you wish to add the user to DO NOT select Notify user by email that they have been added Optional: Enter applicable Role Custom Fields Click Add User Add and Invite a User This step will involve sending an email to the user and allowing them to complete the rest of the registration process. To invite a user: Click on the Manage Users icon in the top right corner of your screen Click on Add User in the top right corner Enter the First Name , Last Name , and Email Address of the user you wish to add Select the Role(s) you wish to add the user to Select Notify user by email that they have been added Optional: Select Include a custom message in the email. This allows you to add further details including the reasoning for the invite to the site Optional: Enter applicable Role Custom Fields Click Add User NOTE: If a custom message is not selected then the generic default message will be sent. Import Users in Bulk In some cases you may need to add multiple users to your site at one time. If this is the case you can use the Import Users feature of the site. In order to upload users in bulk: Click on the Manage Users icon from top of your screen Click on Add User in the top right corner Click Import Users Start by deciding the Role that you wish to upload the users to: Applicant, Reviewer, Recommender Select Download Template . Each Role will have its own CSV template based on the different information required for that role. If you have Custom Fields in the site these fields will also be added as columns to the template. Populate the Template with all of the relevant information of the users ensuring that First Name , Last Name , and Email are filled as these are required fields Once you have saved the file on your computer, select Choose File , under Select a populated user list Choose what you would like to do with Duplicate Email Addresses Optional: Select Notify user by email that they have been added Optional: Select Include a custom message in the email. This allows you to add further details including the reasoning for the invite to the site. The same message will be sent to all users in the CSV file. NOTE: Importing users can only be done one role at a time. If you wish to upload users with multiple roles in the site you will need to repeat the above steps for each role including the user in both CSV files to upload. When the user is added a second time for a second role, SM Apply will add the new role to the existing profile. How to Delete Users Deleting Users To delete a single user from the site: Click on the Manage Users icon in the top right corner of your screen. Locate the user in the list of users in your site. Hover your cursor over the user and click on the More Options icon in the far right column. Click Delete You will be asked ""Are you sure you want to delete these users?"" Click Yes If you wish to delete multiple users at one time: Click on the Manage Users icon in the top right corner of your screen. Select the users you wish to delete from the site Click Actions Click Delete You will be asked ""Are you sure you want to delete these users?"" Click Yes Cautions to Deleting Users When a user is deleted from a site all information that was completed by that user will also be deleted. We advise extreme caution when it comes to deleting Users from the site as this applies to ALL roles (reviewers and their completed reviews included). If you would like to restrict users from accessing the site and maintain the information they have submitted, we would recommend deactivating their account instead from Manage Users. Assuming the Role of a User The purpose of assuming the role of a user is twofold. First, it allows you to test your site including testing the different visibility of users based on roles and programs they are associated with. This can be helpful in determining that each user has access to the right tasks based on their role and activity in the site. Secondly, it allows you to troubleshoot errors that a user may report to you as an administrator to determine if the issue lies with the users actions or with the build of the site. Assume a Role Through Manage Users Click on the Manage Users icon in the top right corner of your screen. Locate the user in the list of users in your site. Hover your cursor over the user and click on the More Options icon in the far right column. Click Assume Role Assume Role Through the Users Profile Click on the Manage Users icon in the top right corner of your screen. Click on the Name of the User Click on the More Options icon in the top right corner Click Assume Role NOTE: If you are in the Full Screen view of the profile: Click Actions Click Assume Role Returning to your Administrative Account Once you are done assuming the role of the user you will need to return to your administrator role. Otherwise, if you try to access administrative tools you will receive an error as the site currently recognizes you as having the permissions of the user you are assuming the role of. To exit the Assume Role feature: Click on the name of the user from the top right hand side of the screen. Select Return to Admin NOTE: Using multiple tabs within SM Apply can be helpful to edit multiple areas within the site simultaneously. In some cases you may find that changes you are making aren't saving or searches you are performing aren't pulling results. This can be due to access restrictions of a role you are currently assuming in another tab. If you receive a 404 error or an ""Oops!"" message it's possible that you did not return to your administrative role before making that change. How To Archive Applications Archiving applications keeps your report data accurate, applicant portal clean, and application management easy. Unlike deleting applications, archiving lets returning users reuse their data. To archive an application from Manage Applications: Select applications to mark as archived Select More Select Archive NOTE: If an application is archived incorrectly the action can be reverted by locating the archived application and restoring it from the More Options menu. Applying Labels to Applications Within SM Apply, it is possible to create and update labels of collected applications. How to Manually Add a Label to Applications Labels are added to applications manually from the Manage Applications page within a program. In some cases labels may be misapplied, but can be corrected manually. To add a label to an application manually: Select an application Select the Labels drop-down Select the label you are adding to the application Select Done Using Automations to Apply Labels Labels are commonly added to an application based on a response given within a form of the application. Instead of monitoring answers to these questions and manually adding labels you can create an automation that will perform this action for you. Apply a Label Based on a Form Response Example: An application form contains a question asking what their current major is. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Task A task has been completed Fill out a form CONDITIONS Application Form: What is your Major? Is exactly Arts ACTION Add a label to the application Arts TIP! When using an activation that will allow the automation to fire when a task has been edited or completed, it is best practice to first remove all labels added previously as action one then apply the label as action 2. This will prevent multiple labels from applying if the applicant returns to the form and changes their answer. This is not recommend if labels are also being applied earlier in the application process. Administrator Application Notes Overview Administrators have the ability to leave notes on applications. Notes can either be private and visible only to themselves, or they can be made public meaning the note will be visible to other administrators as well as all assigned reviewers. To access Application Notes as an administrator: Go to the Admin Application Preview Click on the Notes tab Within this section you can: Add a new public note Add a new private note Edit your own notes Delete a note Add a New Public Note In order to add a note on the application that will be visible to all administrators and reviewers: Go to the Notes tab in the Admin Application Preview Enter the note you wish to add in the Add a Note field Do not select Private note (admin only) to make the note public Optional: Click Email Notifications and select Email assigned reviewers . This will send an email when the note is posted to reviewers assigned to the application to notify them that a new note is available. Click Add Note Add a New Private Note Go to the Notes tab in the Admin Application Preview Enter the note you wish to add in the Add a Note field Select Private note (admin only) to make the note only available to you as an administrator Optional: Click Email Notifications and select Email assigned reviewers . This will send an email to other reviewers assigned to the application to let them know a new note is available. Click Add Note When the note is created it will appear with a Hidden icon beside it to verify that it is only available to you. Edit your Own Notes Within the Admin Application Preview, you have the ability to edit the notes that you have written for an application. To edit a note: Go to the Notes tab in the Admin Application Preview Underneath the Note you wish to edit click the Edit icon Make the necessary changes to the Note Optional: Select or Unselect Private note (admin only) if you wish to change the visibility settings of the note Click Save Changes NOTE: As an administrator, you can edit a note written by a Reviewer by assuming their role and accessing notes. Delete a Note If a Note is no longer applicable to the application you can delete the note altogether. As an Administrator you will have the ability to delete a Note created by you or Reviewers, but not other administrators. To d elete a note: Go to the Notes tab in the Admin Application Preview Underneath the Note you wish to edit click the Delete icon You will be asked ""Are you sure that you want to delete this note?"" Click Yes WARNING! Once a note has been deleted it cannot be retrieved. Emails This section is dedicated to the configuration of emails within your site. To navigate to the Emails page: Select the Settings icon Click More Select Emails Once you have landed on the Emails page you will be presented with three tabs organizing the various emails settings in this area. These tabs are: Email Settings , Notifications and Email Logs . Email Settings Tab While in the Emails Settings tab you can configure the email address that emails are sent from, build Email Templates that you will send out frequently, and customize the design of your emails. This tab is presented in three parts: Email Settings, Email Templates and Email Design. Addresses (Default Sender) This option allows you to set the email address from which all automatic responses are sent to users. By default all automatic emails will be sent using the SurveyMonkey Apply No-Reply email (noreply@smapply.io). However, you can customize the name that the emails are sent from in order to personalize the emails to your site. Additionally, you have the option of making the email address a custom email .

If you have applied multiple filters, selecting Save will save the combination of filters applied at the time it was saved. Saved filters will not be overwritten if new filters are applied after the filter was saved. How to Apply Saved Custom Filters To apply a saved filter: Select the New Custom Filter dropdown menu. Select one of the available filters. How to Edit Saved Custom Filters Editing a Custom Filter that has been saved does not extend past the ability to rename the filter. Any additional filters added to an existing saved filter can be saved again, but will not overwrite the original filter.

GetFeedback makes it easy to create Net Promoter® Score (NPS) surveys and map the survey responses directly into Salesforce. You can use Salesforce reporting to calculate NPS and create dashboards to display key customer feedback. This article discusses how to measure NPS with Salesforce using GetFeedback. This is just a suggested setup - your NPS program should be customized to fit your organization’s needs. GetFeedback Support can’t consult on coding issues. Reach out to your Salesforce administrator for help implementing these features. These examples help you get started with our Salesforce integration and you may need to make changes for your organization. Before You Start Connect your survey to Salesforce so you can map and calculate NPS scores in Salesforce. Creating an NPS Survey Object in Salesforce Create a custom object in Salesforce called NPS Survey. It should contain the following fields: Survey Name (Text) Contact (Master / Detail Lookup – Contact) Email (Email) Net Promoter Score (Number) Comments (Long Text) NPS Response URL (Text, URL) NPS Grouping (Formula, result: Text) Promoter (Formula, result: Number) Passive (Formula, result: Number) Detractor (Formula, result: Number) Grouping NPS Responses NPS Grouping is a formula that categorizes survey respondents as Promoters (9 & 10), Passives (7 & 8), or Detractors (6 & below) based on their Net Promoter Score. You can decide to display images or text in this field. For example, you can use stars, hearts, or other icons to help people quickly identify scores. NPS Grouping with Images The formula below adds images to each NPS grouping. IF(NOT(ISBLANK(Net_Promoter_Score__c)),( IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c<< 7, IMAGE(""/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=015o0000001blTH"", ""Detractor""), IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 8,IMAGE(""/servlet/servlet.FileDownload? file=015o0000001blTN"", ""Promoter""), IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 6, Net_Promoter_Score__c < 9, “Passive”, IMAGE(""/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=015o0000001blTM"", ""Passive"")))), """") NPS Grouping without Images The formula below groups NPS scores without using images. IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c < 7, ""Detractor"", IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 6, Net_Promoter_Score__c < 9, “Passive&#201D;, IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 8, ""Promoter""))) Totaling NPS Scores The Promoter, Passive, and Detractor fields allow you to total the number of responses you’ve received for each NPS grouping. You need these grouping totals in order to calculate your Net Promoter Score in Salesforce. These fields don’t need to be visible on the page layout. Use these formulas to total the number of responses for each group: Promoter : IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 8, 1, 0) Passive : IF(AND(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 6, Net_Promoter_Score__c < 9), 1, 0) Detractor : IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c < 7, 1, 0) Creating a Custom Report for NPS Scores Create a custom report type in Salesforce for your NPS object. You’ll use this report to calculate your NPS score. Calculating NPS Scores To calculate NPS scores in Salesforce: Create a new Salesforce summary report using your NPS report type. You can choose to summarize NPS by Survey Name, or filter the report to only show specific Surveys. Write a summary formula in your report to calculate your score. The code snippet below is an example of an NPS calculation formula. NPS calculation formula : (NPS_Survey__c.Promoter__c:SUM/RowCount*100) - (NPS_Survey__c.Detractor__c:SUM/RowCount*100) Mapping NPS Scores from GetFeedback to Salesforce Map your response data to the corresponding Salesforce fields using custom mappings . For example, you can map the survey name, NPS score, and any comments to your custom Salesforce fields.

Managing Seats on Your Enterprise Team,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/manage-enterprise/,"Managing Seats on Your Enterprise Team | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article My Team Inviting People to Join Importing Users by CSV Managing Pending Invitations Reassigning or Deleting Accounts User Statuses Help Teams & Enterprise Managing Teams Managing Seats on Your Enterprise Team SurveyMonkey Managing Seats on Your Enterprise Team My Team Inviting People to Join Importing Users by CSV Managing Pending Invitations Reassigning or Deleting Accounts User Statuses ENTERPRISE TEAMS: This article is for Enterprise teams. If you have Team Advantage or Team Premier, see Managing seats on your Team . My Team If you're a Primary Admin or Admin, you can invite people to join your team and manage existing seats from the My Team section of your account. My Team is the central place to find your Enterprise team information. You can find it in the main navigation. Team Summary Under the Team Summary tab, Primary Admins and Admins get an overview of the team. Term Description Seat An account on the team that you've already paid for. There may be 2 types : Power seats and Casual seats. Seats Used (or Filled seats) The accounts on your team that are already assigned to someone. This includes seats in the Active , Invited , or Reassignment pending status. Seats Available (or Empty seats) The number of seats you've already paid for, but aren't being used yet. If you're interested in more Power seats, reach out to your Customer Success Manager. Team Size (or Total seats) The sum of seats used and seats available. In other words, the total number of people who can be in, or invited to. Team Name The name of your team. The Primary Admin can update this at any time. Team Description Up to 250 characters describing your team to help others identify your team from others at the same company. The Primary Admin can update this at any time. Primary Admin The person who created the team—this person manages seats and team billing. Account Ownership The person we consider the owner of the team . Responses Monitor how many responses your team has collected so far. Usage See user metrics over time (UTC). Inviting People to Join Under the Add Users tab, you can send an email to invite people to fill available seats. Enterprise teams can also see an option to create a team sign-up page where people in your organization can send invites to themselves to join. Teams with SSO enabled won't see either of these options and can send your team’s invite link to people . Send an email invitation To invite people to your team via email: Go to My Team . Select Add Users . Choose Send an email. Enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite. Enter multiple addresses separated by commas, or put each email address on its own line. Customize the email message. Select Send Invitations . Team Sign-Up Page ENTERPRISE FEATURE: Team sign-up pages are only available to Enterprise customers. You can activate a sign-up page and share the URL to allow people to join your team on their own. Anyone with the link can enter their email address to send themselves an invitation. To create a sign-up page: Go to My Team . Select Add Users . Choose Use a sign-up page . In the Maximum signups field, enter a limit for how many people can sign up. Select Activate page . Copy the link and share it however you'd like. Teams with SSO enabled won't see these options. Instead, admins can send your team’s invite link to people . You can manage your team sign-up page from the Add Users tab of My Team. Expand | Collapse Monitoring Sign-Ups You can see the number of signups started through your sign-up page at any time. This number indicates how many people have requested an invitation through the sign-up page—not how many people have signed up for an account from the invitation. To see the number of signups started through your team sign-up page: Go to My Team . Select Add Users . Choose Activate a sign-up page . Under the link, you'll see the number of signups initiated out of the maximum number of signups you chose when you created the page. Deactivating Your Sign-Up Page You can deactivate a sign-up page at any time to prevent any new people from joining your team through the link. Anyone that already started the sign-up process through the link will still be able to complete it, unless you cancel the invitation. To deactivate a sign-up page: Go to My Team . Select Add Users . Under the URL for the sign-up page, select Deactivate Page . Select Deactivate . If someone tries going to a deactivated sign-up page, they'll see a message that the page was deactivated. Importing Users by CSV Primary Admins and Admins can add or update their team's division , and custom role assignments by importing a CSV file. If your team has SSO enabled, you can't add users via CSV import. Spreadsheet Setup View our example screenshot to see how to properly format your CSV file. Create a spreadsheet in an application like Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets. Make sure you set up your spreadsheet's first row with the following header fields: Username , Email , Role , Division (user), Division (admin) . Follow these guidelines when adding data to your spreadsheet: Each User is on their own row Username is required and matches what's in SurveyMonkey The file can have up to 10,000 rows and is less than 5MB Use commas to separate the division names if adding a User as a Division Admin of multiple divisions For the Role column*, find the right role in this list and, in the cell, use the term next to it: Role CSV Term Primary Admin account_owner Admin admin Division Admin division_admin Power User regular Casual User casual Pending invite unspecified *For CSV Terms for customized roles, see Custom Roles . Saving your CSV file You may be able to save your CSV file in various .csv formats and not all formats will save and import successfully. Try saving your file as either: CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) | MS-DOS Comma Separated How to Import To import a CSV file: Go to the Manage Users tab. (Optional) Select Export CSV to download a complete list of users in your team and their account status. Select Import CSV . (Optional) Select Download example template to download a properly formatted CSV file that you can edit and re-import. Drag and drop or browse your computer to attach your CSV file. Select Next . Preview the first 5 rows of your CSV to confirm your data is in the right order and select Next . Once your import is finished select Download report to view the import status per user and any import errors. Once you dismiss the Import finished message, you won't be able to download the report. Import Errors Once your import is finished, you’ll be able to Download a report to view the import status for each row. If there are errors, you can fix them and re-import the file to try again. If there's an Import Error it could be: The data isn't formatted properly. The columns aren't in the right order. There's extra data in your spreadsheet. There are more than 10,000 rows or your spreadsheet is over 5 MB. The file needs to be saved in a different CSV format. The spreadsheet includes more users than there are seats in your team. You're changing a Power User to a Casual User more than one time within a 90 day time frame. Expand | Collapse Why can't I invite more people? If you can't send an invite or people can't invite themselves from the team sign-up page, you may have an outstanding invoice you need to pay. Once you pay any unpaid invoices, you'll be able to invite more people to your team. Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) for more information. Can team members see existing surveys? Your surveys are private to your account account unless you choose to share them with others or your Team Sharing settings automatically share all new surveys with your team. Primary Admins are able to see what surveys are in each team member's account and can manage them. Managing Pending Invitations Email Invitations You can manage pending team invitations sent via email from the Manage Users tab of My Team. If someone has a pending invitation but you invite them to a different seat type , the most recent invitation will override the previous request. Expand | Collapse Resending an Invitation You can resend an invitation to anyone with the Invited or Invitation Expired status. You're not charged team overages for resending invitations. To resend an invitation: Go to My Team . Select Manage Users . Find the person you want to send another invitation to. Select the three dots ( ... ) to the right of that person and select Resend Invitation . Choose from the following options: Resend Invitation : Sends another email invitation inviting the person to join your team. Copy invitation link : Gives you a link you can share with the person. This link is uniquely tied to the person you're resending the invitation to, so you should only give the link to that person directly. Canceling an Invitation You can cancel any invitation in the Invited status. Canceling an invitation will disable the invitation link that was already sent out. If you cancel an invite, you can send someone else an invite at no additional cost as long as you have seats available. To cancel an invitation: Go to My Team . Select Manage Users . Find the person whose invitation you'd like to cancel. Select the three dots ( ... ) to the right of that person. Select Cancel Invitation . Select Yes to confirm. Reassigning or Deleting Accounts As the people you need to work with change, you can reassign or delete accounts from the Manage Users tab of My Team. Expand | Collapse Reassigning an Account You can reassign any seat or Admin account in your team to another person who isn’t already on your team, along with all of the surveys and data contained within it. You're not charged team overages for reassigning accounts since you were already charged for the seat. To reassign an account: Go to My Team . Select Manage Users . Find the account you'd like to reassign. Select the three dots ( ... ) to the right of that account and choose Reassign Account . Enter the email address of the person you want to reassign the account to. Select Send email . Until the new person accepts their invitation, the status of the account will be Reassignment pending . If the account has any shared surveys , they will remain shared with the account— even after it's reassigned to a different person. TIP! Primary Admins can transfer surveys over to an existing team member. Deleting an Account Before deleting an account, we highly recommend contacting the current owner to ensure that there is no survey data within the account that needs to be kept or transferred to another account in the team. Also, please consider the following precautions and reminders before deletion: - This is a permanent action and cannot be undone. - All survey data within the account will be permanently deleted. - The username will no longer be associated with the account. - Any surveys owned by this account and shared by others will be permanently deleted, and anyone with access to their surveys will lose access. - If the account owner created any collectors on a survey shared with them , the survey owner will get View only access to that collector. It's not possible to modify or close an open collector created by an account that's been deleted. - Their seat is not deleted from your team. Instead, the seat becomes available, so you can invite another person to your team at no additional cost. To delete an account in your team: Go to My Team . Select Manage Users . Find the account you'd like to delete. Select the three dots ( ... ) to the right of that account and choose Delete Account . Select Delete to permanently delete the account. You can't delete the Primary Admin, but you are able to reassign the Primary Admin account. Changing the Primary Admin If you can’t log into the Primary Admin account, contact support. The Primary Admin can edit their account details (name, email address, etc.) to the new person's details. However, steps to complete this process depend on whether the new person is already on the team: Change to someone who isn't on the team yet To change the Primary Admin: Log into your Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Change the email address on your account to the email address of the person you want to be the new Primary Admin. Change to someone who is on the team Changing the Primary Admin to someone else that's already part of your team is a multi-step process. If you're the current Primary Admin, follow these steps to switch the Primary Admin to someone else that's already on your team: Before you do anything, ask the other person to log in to their account and transfer their surveys to the current Primary Admin account. Log in to the Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Select My Team from the main navigation. Select Manage Users . Find the person who you want to be the new Primary Admin. If their email address is linked to multiple SurveyMonkey accounts, you will need to contact support or choose different email address for the Primary Admin account. Delete their account from the team . Change the email address on your account to the email address of the new person. If the original Primary Admin still needs to be in the team, the new Primary Admin can invite them to fill the open seat at no additional cost. If you change the email address on your account to someone else, you'll lose access to the account and all surveys and data within it. You won't be a part of the team anymore unless the new Primary Admin invites you to join the team. To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) when reassigning an Account TIP! The new user must have SSO credentials already configured by your IT department. To link an SSO log-in to a reassigned account: Reassign the Account . The new person needs to accept the email invitation to join the team and set up a new password. Send your team’s invite link to the new user. When selecting the invite link they will be given the option to create or convert an account to log in with SSO. To complete the seat reassignment: Select convert an account . After that initial set up, your new team member will log into SurveyMonkey or the SurveyMonkey app with SSO. TIP! You can also change someone's seat type or role . User Statuses You can check the status of every account in your team from the Manage Users tab. Here's what each status means: Status Description Active This person has accepted their invitation to join your team. Invited This person was invited to join the team, but hasn't accepted their invitation yet. Reassignment Pending This account is in the process of being reassigned to someone else. This means that the Primary Admin or an Admin sent an invitation to someone else to take over this account, but they haven't accepted the invitation yet. Neither the original owner of the account, nor the new owner, will be able to access the account until the person to whom you reassigned the account accepts the invitation. If needed, you can reassign an account in this status to a different person. Invitation Expired This person was invited to join the team, but didn't accept the invitation within 30 days. Invitations expire within 30 days, but you can always resend the invitation to them. TIP! Use custom roles to provide more Admin support, give users access to certain features or to limit permissions on the team.

This article covers how to move applications to any stage in your workflow either manually or by using SurveyMonkey Apply automations. Manually Move an Application Applications within the workflow may need to be moved for a variety of reasons such as to allow applicants to edit or complete tasks or to allow a reviewer to edit or complete a review.

Move from Application Management Page Go to the Manage Applications page within a program. Select the checkbox to the left of the application's title. Select Workflow . Click Move Stage . Select the stage to move the application to from the drop-down menu. Optional: Enable email applicant to notify the applicant of the movement.

Taxes on SurveyMonkey Purchases,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/taxes/,"Taxes on SurveyMonkey Purchases | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article United States European Union & United Kingdom Brazil Other Countries Help Payments & Billing Invoices & Receipts Taxes on SurveyMonkey Purchases SurveyMonkey Taxes on SurveyMonkey Purchases United States European Union & United Kingdom Brazil Other Countries Depending on your billing location, taxes may be included in the price of subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases, or it may be added as a separate line item on your invoice. If you don’t see your billing country listed below, SurveyMonkey doesn't add taxes to your purchase price. It’s your responsibility as a consumer or business to pay any applicable taxes to your local government, as needed. Some organizations and businesses may be exempt from sales tax. If you're currently receiving a charity or nonprofit discount you aren't automatically exempt from paying sales tax, and need to complete the exemption process based on your location. Visit our Legal Center for more information on how we assess and charge sales tax. United States SurveyMonkey is required to charge sales tax in certain U.S. locations to comply with local laws. If the billing address for your current payment method is located in a region that collects sales tax, you'll see the tax on your SurveyMonkey invoice starting February 1st, 2019. This tax applies to all SurveyMonkey products, including SurveyMonkey Enterprise, SurveyMonkey Audience, and our other business solutions . Tax Rate Local tax rates vary depending on your state, county, and city. Make sure your current Billing Details are up to date so that we can charge the correct tax rate. SurveyMonkey may not assess tax in some locations or on some of its services. If you want to estimate your potential sales tax, the best way is to use an online sales tax calculator . Tax Exemption Some organizations and businesses may be exempt from sales tax. If you believe your organization qualifies for tax-exempt status, apply for tax exemption before you upgrade or renew your account. If you've already made a purchase and still need to provide a tax exemption certificate, you have a limited amount of time , depending on your billing location. Once your exemption status has been approved, future purchases will be exempt from tax where applicable. You can check your current exemption status in the Billing Profile section of the Billing Details page. If you're charged tax after your exemption status has been approved, please contact us . Tax Exemption Certificate Timelines The amount of time you have to submit a tax exemption certificate after upgrading or renewal varies based on billing location.

Likewise, it's really common to ask people to evaluate how often they do something, how satisfied they are with an experience, or how important something is to them. Even though these questions are super common, sometimes it's tricky to figure out the best way to word these field labels and answer choices. And for things like a dropdown of U.S. States, it would be time-consuming to add every choice one by one. Wufoo provides lots of pre-written sets of answer choices (available in English only) that you can add to certain field types to save you time. You can also copy and paste your own predefined answer choices in bulk. To import predefined choices: Log in and go to Forms . Click the form you want to edit. Go to the Field Settings tab of a Multiple Choice or Dropdown field on your form. In the Choices section, click Import Predefined Choices . Select a category. Review the answer choices, and edit them however you'd like. Just make sure that every answer choice is separated by a line break. Click Add Choices to Field . Click Save Form . TIP!

Only survey owners can manage smart notifications and their conditions, but they can share those notifications with others. TIP! You can find your Smart Notifications from the last 30 days in the Notification Center. Video Overview Creating a Smart Notification How Smart Notifications Work A smart notification is sent when a survey response meets a set of conditions, called a trigger. Conditions can be based on specific survey answers, or custom variables. Each trigger can have multiple conditions, which must all be met for a smart notification to send. Smart notifications won't send for disqualified responses . Setting up Smart Notifications Smart notifications are survey-specific. If you have multiple surveys you want to receive notifications for, you need to create smart notifications for each one. You can set up to 10 smart notifications per survey. Only the survey owner can set up smart notifications on their survey. To create a smart notification: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click Manage Notifications . Click the Create button next to Smart notifications. Choose your trigger criteria. These are the conditions that need to be met for a notification to send. (Optional) Click +Condition to add another condition to the same trigger. By default, this links your conditions with AND logic. If you want to use OR logic instead, click the AND button to change it. It's not possible to use AND/OR logic together in the same trigger. Click Add Recipients to share the notification with others. When you share smart notifications with someone, they’ll get an email to let them know. If you want to receive the notification, check the Include me as a recipient box. (Optional) Customize the subject line and message of your email so recipients know why they're getting the notification. Click Save .

What Emails you Get When you create a smart notification, you can choose to send emails to yourself or share them with others. Anyone you select will get an email each time a survey response is submitted that matches the trigger conditions you set up. The email has a link to view the individual response, which people can see without logging in to a SurveyMonkey account. The link stays active for 90 days after the notification is sent. TIP! If you turned on notifications but you're not getting emails, try these troubleshooting tips . You'll still see them as messages in the Notification Center .

Collaborators: Overview,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/collaborators/,"Collaborators: Overview | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Enable Collaborators on a Program How to Configure Collaborator Access What Happens Next? Help Build Programs Collaborators: Overview Apply Collaborators: Overview How to Enable Collaborators on a Program How to Configure Collaborator Access What Happens Next? Enabling Collaborators on a program allows a user to add additional members to their application. This is useful for applications requiring collaboration and multi-user access without those users needing to share a login account for access. How to Enable Collaborators on a Program Enabling Collaborators is specific to each program in your site. In order to enable collaborators: Go to the Program Settings Go to the Applications tab Enable Allow Collaborators Optional: Restrict collaborators to specific email domains. An example of this would be if your organization is an education system and wish to ensure that only users with your institutions' domain are added to the application. Optional: Add instructions to your applicants on who they should invite to their application Save & Exit the Program How to Configure Collaborator Access If you wish to configure which tasks in your workflow your collaborators will have access to you can enable a setting in each task. NOTE: This process will only determine who can Edit the task, however, all members of the application will be able to View all completed forms in the application. Go to the Workflow Access the Stage Configurations of the Application Stage Go to the Tasks tab Click on the Task Click on the dropdown under ""Set who can edit this task"" NOTE: This is only available if Collaborators are enabled Select the restriction between the three Options Available i. Applicants & Collaborators ii. Applicants Only iii. Collaborators Only NOTE: By Default ""Applicants & Collaborators"" will be selected for each applicant task. Optional: If ""Collaborators Only"" was selected, enter instructions on who the applicant should request as a collaborator to complete the task. Example: Applicants in your site under the age of 18 require a consent form from their Parent or Guardian. Therefore, we want to add the Parent/ Guardian as a collaborator of the site in order to access the application and complete the consent form. However, we do not wish for the Applicant to be able to edit this form themselves. Therefore, based on the steps above we would select ""Collaborators Only."" What Happens Next? Once you have configured the collaborator process within your program and workflow, Applicants will be able to begin inviting collaborators to their application. There are three major components to this process: 1. Applicant Completes the Collaborator Invite Within the applicant's application on the left side of the screen, they will be able to click the Add Collaborators button. Upon doing so they can enter the email address of the collaborator they are adding, set the permissions of the user to View & Edit or View Only and provide an optional message to the collaborator. NOTE: If you have a Collaborator Only task, collaborators would need to have View & Edit status in order to edit the task. 2. Collaborator Receives the Invite Once the invite is sent the collaborator will receive it at the email provided by the applicant. Within the email, the collaborator will be able to Join the application or Decline the invite. Upon clicking Join Now within the email the collaborator will be able to either Login or complete the registration process, depending on if they already have an account. Once they have logged in they will be successfully added as a collaborator to the application. NOTE: If the collaborator is sent an invite to multiple applications, they will need to Join each application through the email that is sent. 3. Collaborator completes any required tasks After the Collaborator has accepted the request and logged in they will have access to the application. Their permissions will depend both on the settings that have been given to the task as well as the permissions set by the applicant.

Restricting Survey Access by Password or IP Address,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/restricting-survey-access/,"Restricting Survey Access by Password or IP Address | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Password Protection IP Restrictions Restricting Access to Shared Surveys Help Sending Surveys Collector & Response Options Restricting Survey Access by Password or IP Address SurveyMonkey Restricting Survey Access by Password or IP Address Password Protection IP Restrictions Restricting Access to Shared Surveys You can restrict access to your survey from the collector options . If you turn on Password Protection, respondents need to enter a password in order to take the survey. If you turn on IP Restrictions, you can allow or block a list of IP addresses. TIP! Collectors are ways to send your survey. Each collector type works a little differently, so they all have different sets of options to choose from when you set them up. If you don't see this particular option in the collector type you're using, review the info on this page, and be sure to check out the help article about that collector type . Password Protection If you turn on Password Protection, when respondents click the survey link, they'll be prompted to enter a password in order to access the survey. There isn't a way to create a unique password for each respondent. To add a password to your survey: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector and access the collector options . You may need to click Show advanced options . Turn on Password Protection . Enter the desired password. Customize the password required message and the error message that appears when respondents enter an incorrect password. The font formatting used for your survey password prompt can be controlled by setting the Answer choice font setting . Password Limitations Password Protection isn't available when In-Response Email Capture is turned on. To enable Password Protection, turn off In-Email Response Capture in your collector settings. IP Restrictions To restrict access to your survey based on the IP addresses of your respondents: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector and access the collector options . You may need to click Show advanced options . Turn on IP Restrictions . Choose either to allow only a specific list of IP address to take your survey or to block a specific list of IP addresses from taking your survey. Enter the IP addresses. You can enter up to 4,096 characters. Click Edit ""survey closed"" message . If someone's IP address is blocked, they'll see this closed message . Using Wildcards in IP Addresses IP addresses are represented in dot-decimal notation—four different numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by decimal points. Each number represents 8 bits (an octet) of the IP address. Here's an example with each of the four octets shown in a different color: 172.16.254.1 You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to allow or block a particular range of IP addresses by octet. Here are some examples: Example Formats Description 192.* Includes IPs that start with the first octet. The second, third, and fourth octets could each be any number from 0 to 255. 192.0.* Includes IPs that start with the first two octets. The third and fourth octets could each be any number from 0 to 255. 192.0.2.* Includes IPs that start with the first three octets. The fourth octet could be any number from 0 to 255. 192.0.*.2 Includes IPs that start with the first two octets and end with the fourth octet. The third octet could be any number from 0 to 255. 192.*.2 Includes all IPs that contain the first and third octet. The second and fourth octets could each be any number from 0 to 255. This equivalent to 192.*.2.*, only you don't need to put the last asterisk. TIP! If you want only a particular group of people to access your survey and you don't know all the IP addresses you need to allow or block, we recommend adding a password to your survey instead. Restricting Access to Shared Surveys If you're in a team , you can share a survey with others and set permissions to limit what they can do with the survey. For example, you can give someone View Only access to the survey design, and no access to analyze results.

How to Add OAuth Details,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/oauth-details/,"How to Add OAuth Details | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How it Works Configuration Instructions Things to note Setup Additional Information Help Advanced Features How to Add OAuth Details Apply How to Add OAuth Details How it Works Configuration Instructions Things to note Setup Additional Information How it Works SSO works by creating an integration between a client's IdP and Apply via the OAUTH protocol. The handshake passes along key user information, including the UID. The key role of the IdP is to verify, for Apply, that the users information is known, and correct account details have been provided. Due to the technical nature of implementing an SSO Integration, and the vast number of authentication services that clients can have, Apply requires there to be a technical expert on the client’s end who has a background or strong knowledge of SSO. Configuration Instructions Things to note We operate in a multi-tenant environment and do not allow for any custom OAuth development, our OAuth integration is already coded and complete Ensure your IT person is familiar with your IdP server environment, and that none of their colleagues are making unknown changes to it while you are setting up and testing your SSO configuration If you would like us to be able to troubleshoot your OAuth config, please provide us with credentials for a test user account (username & password) Seeing an error message of "" redirect_uri_mismatch "" means that you have not permitted your OAuth configuration (on the IdP side) to communicate with the following URI: https://<yoursite>.fluidreview.com/sso/oauth/ Seeing an error message of `invalid_grant` this means that the authorization code or refresh token that you are using is expired. There can be a number of reasons why this may be happening - please review your configuration. If you are able to successfully sign on to SurveyMonkey Apply but your email address is not appearing correctly, make sure that you have not already created an account using the same email that is being sent via the SSO. If you have, then there is a conflict. Please notify your Specialist or Support if this occurs in order to disassociate the accounts. Setup To begin setup: Go to Settings Click on Registration . Scroll down to the bottom Select OAuth from the Sign-On Provider dropdown menu. Complete the available OAuth Fields OAuth Fields to Complete Fields Description Consumer Key (Client ID) API Key associated with the software you are authenticating with (identification for the client). It must be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles. Friendly Name Provide a title for this OAuth integration. This name will be shown to your users. OAuth version 1.0 or 2.0, depending on your version. Ensure that you know which version you are using! Authorize URL Taken from your resource server after the user has been authorized. This can be considered a log-in point to the software identifying server. https://example.com/oauth/authorize Access Token URL An object that contains the security identity. An access token is the string used when making authenticated requests to the API. https://authorization-server.com/token Access Token URL (Method) The HTTP method to use when communicating with the above Access Token URL If Version 1.0 Authenticate URL: The endpoint for the authorization server, which retrieves the authorization code. If Version 2.0 Profile URL: Leads to the profile that you are providing SM Apply Access to. You will have control of what the system has access to. This should be a URL that returns a JSON object, containing all of the properties you are passing to Apply, such as Entity ID, First Name, Last Name, Email and any custom fields. Examples of an Entity ID include: id user_id uid screen_name username SurveyMonkey Apply requires Entity ID, First Name, Last Name and Email Address for all users in order to successfully create the user account. Any additional properties you wish to pass are optional and dependent on your specific requirements. Additional Information In addition to testing that the sign-in components are working correctly, full tests through complete applications should be run using users coming in through the SSO, testing all potential submissions, links, tasks and resources ensuring everything is working as desired. If issues are discovered during initial testing of the SSO there are some key pieces of information required to help resolve the issue: the type of user being tested, the login credentials for that user, and the error message (if one is displayed). Screenshots of error messages are always encouraged.

Proper Formatting for SUM Expressions Sum of a Column Sum of a Row Sum of a Range Help Advanced Features How to Calculate the Sum (SUM) Apply How to Calculate the Sum (SUM) What is the SUM Function? Proper Formatting for SUM Expressions Sum of a Column Sum of a Row Sum of a Range Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. The most common formula that can be used is the SUM function. This article will demonstrate how to configure a SUM expression using AEP within a form. What is the SUM Function? The SUM function will sum a list of values from a number of given fields and is the most commonly used function within expression piping. A SUM function can be created by listing the identifiers of the questions you want to add together. Proper Formatting for SUM Expressions The setup and formatting of the SUM expression are imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the sum of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the SUM expression should be set up as follows: {{ SUM(variable1,variable2) }} Each expression is always contained within a pair of double braces {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of SUM and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive for the spelling of the Identifier Always close each SUM operation with brackets ( ) In addition to listing the values in specific text response cells and questions, you can also pull a SUM of Columns, Rows, and Ranges from Single- and Multi-Column questions, as well as Scores from closed-ended questions. Sum of a Column {{ SUM(q1[:0]) }} Based on Grid Indexing , this will find the sum of column 1. Sum of a Row {{ SUM(q2[1:]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will find the sum of Row 2. Sum of a Range {{ SUM(q1[0:4]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will give you the sum of the first 4 cells. Sum of Scores {{ SUM(q1.score,q2.score,q3.score) }} The score given to each of the 3 questions will be added to the sum. NOTE: In this example, three questions have been given identifiers of q1, q2, and q3. These questions exist within the same form. TIP! Remember that the first row in a table is referred to as row 0 as it generally holds column headers. Looking at the sum of a row example above, if we were looking to calculate row 3, the expression would appear as {{ SUM(q2[2:]) }}. Sum of a Column {{ SUM(Q1[:0]) }} Sum of a Row {{ SUM(Q1[0:]) }} Sum of a Range {{ SUM(Q1[0:5]) }} Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Log in Sign up free Our A/B Test feature allows you to randomly display different versions of a question, image, or free-standing text, and set the percentage of respondents that will be shown each variable. When you analyze your results, you can assess how the different stimuli affected responses. Creating an A/B Test Set up your A/B Test on the Design Survey page. Expand | Collapse Image A/B Test Image A/B Tests allow you to display different images to different sets of respondents. The image will be independent of any questions, so you can add follow-up questions that refer to the image. You can add up to 20 image variations to a single Image A/B Test question. To add an Image A/B Test: From the Build section of the left sidebar, drag and drop Image A/B Test into your survey. Upload an image for each variable, or add an image via URL. (Optional) You can add the following labels to your variable: Image Label: Survey takers see this text with the image. Variable Label: This is how your image is labeled in the Analyze Results section. Survey takers won't see this text. Descriptive Text (Alt Text): Text that makes your image accessible for people using a screen reader, but isn't visible on the survey page. Click + to add another variable if needed. Text A/B Test Text A/B Tests allow you to display variations in free-standing text to different sets of respondents. The text will be independent of any questions, so you can follow it with questions that ask respondents to refer to the text. You can add up to 20 variations in a single Text A/B Test question. To add a Text A/B Test: From the Build section of the left sidebar, drag and drop Text A/B Test into your survey. In the A and B fields, enter the two variables you want to show to respondents. Click + to add another variable if needed. Question Text A/B Test Question Text A/B Tests allow you to display up to 20 variations in question text to different sets of respondents. To enable a Question Text A/B Test: Click an existing question to edit it. Or, add a new question to your survey. Click the Options tab. Click Enable Question Text A/B Test (Random Assignment) . Go back to the Edit tab. In the A field, enter the question text for the first variable. Click + to add another variable if needed. In the % field to the right of each variable, enter the percentage of overall respondents you want to show the variable to. Unsupported Question Types You can enable Question Text A/B Tests for any question type, except Net Promoter Score, File Upload, or Matrix of Dropdown Menus. Video A/B Test You can use the formatting toolbar in a Text or Question Text A/B Test to add a video into each variable field. As you add variables, the respondent percentages will split evenly across all variables. However, you can enter your own percentages if you prefer. Variable percentages must total 100%. These percentages determine the probability of a new respondent seeing that variable when they take your survey. Previewing A/B Tests Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design a few times to see what your survey will look like to respondents. You'll be shown different A/B Test variables each time you preview your survey. As people take your survey, SurveyMonkey randomly assigns each respondent to be shown a certain variable based on the percentages you define. Analyzing A/B Test Results There are several areas in the Analyze Results section where you can view and analyze the results of your A/B test. Under the Question Summaries tab, you can see the number and percentage of respondents that viewed each variable. In the CURRENT VIEW section of the left sidebar, you can Filter by A/B Test or Compare by A/B Test . Under the Individual Responses tab, you can see which variable each respondent was shown. You can filter or compare by A/B test for these question types: Multiple Choice, Checkboxes, Star Rating, Dropdown, Matrix/Rating Scale, Ranking, and Image Choice. You may notice that the distribution of respondents that saw each variable doesn't exactly match the percentages you defined. The more responses you collect, the more likely it is that your results will reflect the percentages. Since variables are randomly assigned, we do not guarantee the split will be exact, particularly for smaller numbers of participants. We suggest collecting at least 50 responses. TIP! See if there are significant differences in how respondents who saw different variables answered your survey.

Using Standard Events,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/app-standard-events/,"Using Standard Events | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Before You Begin Type of Standard Events Campaign Trigger Queues Help Survey channels Mobile App Using Standard Events GetFeedback Using Standard Events Before You Begin Type of Standard Events Campaign Trigger Queues When creating an app campaign , such as a popup survey, you’ll target specific website visitors by implementing events. When an event is triggered, GetFeedback shows the survey to your website visitor. Standard events let you target visitors after common events, such as updating or opening the app, without extra work from your app developers. Here is a list of standard events you can use: App launch: Show a campaign when someone opens the app a certain number of times App closed early: Show a campaign when someone closes the app after only a few seconds. App updated: Show a campaign when someone has updated the app to a specific version. App not updated: Show a campaign when someone uses an older version of your app. App crash: Show a campaign after the app has crashed a certain number of times. Specific date: Show a campaign on a certain date. Standard events don't require any additional setup. This means that you won't need to implement these key events yourself, saving you valuable time so that you can start listening to your customers even faster. If you need to target users after specific events related to your app, you may need to implement a custom event with the support of your app development team. Before You Begin Standard events are available on the following SDKs: iOS version v6.12.0 and up Android version v7.6.0 and up If your app uses one of our SDK bridges please check the availability of the Standard Events in the release notes. For the best results, make sure to follow the implementation guide in Readme of the SDK. Not following certain steps, such as recommended moment to initialize the SDK, might prevent certain standard events from working as expected. Type of Standard Events App Launch Show your campaign after someone opens the app after it was closed. The App launch event triggers as soon as the GetFeedback SDK is initialized or when your app is launched after it was closed before. Conditions: Trigger after the event has occurred: Enter the number of times someone should open the app before GetFeedback should show your campaign. App Closed Early The App Closed Early event triggers when the app is launched after it was closed early. You determine how long someone should spend in the app before we consider the app to close early. Conditions: Time spent in app: How many seconds after opening that the person should close the app. Target: Choose to target either First time users or Returning users who close the app early. App Updated Show your campaign to users who have updated your app to a certain version. The App Updated event triggers as soon as the GetFeedback SDK is initialized or when your app is launched after it was closed before. Conditions: iOS version: Enter the version of your iOS app that should trigger the event. Android version: Enter the version of your Android app that should trigger the event. Trigger when ap is launched x times on this version: If you want to let people use the updated app a few times before seeing a survey, enter a number in the field. App Not Updated Show your campaign to users who haven’t updated their app to a certain version. The App Not Updated event triggers as soon as the GetFeedback SDK is initialized or when your app is launched after it was closed before. Conditions: iOS version is below: Enter an app version. The campaign will be triggered if a user's app is on an earlier version. Android version is below: Enter an app version. The campaign will be triggered if a user's app is on an earlier version. App Crash Show your campaign after the app has crashed a certain number of times. The App Crash event triggers as soon as the GetFeedback SDK is initialized or when your App is launched after it has crashed. Conditions Trigger when event has occurred: Set the number of times the app should crash before showing your campaign. Specific Date Choose a date and time to show your campaign. The Specific Date event lets you set the occurrence number and the specific date. The occurrence number lets define how many times your app needs to be launched on the specified date before the event will trigger. Conditions: Date: Enter the date to show the campaign. Trigger when app is launched: Enter the number of times someone should open the app on this date before seeing the campaign. Show the campaign after: Enter a time to show the campaign after. The campaign won’t be shown before this time, even if the user matches other conditions. Campaign Trigger Queues Most standard events show your campaign after the app has been launched. If you've created several campaigns with similar targeting options, you might have more than 1 campaign to show to the user. When multiple campaigns are triggered, the SDK will make use of a so-called Campaign Trigger Queue. The queue prioritizes campaigns to make sure that only 1 campaign is shown per app launch. The queue prioritizes campaigns based on a few factors: Type of standard event, with Launch taking the highest priority. Campaign creation date. It's best to limit the number of campaigns using identical standard events and similar targeting options.

Limiting Responses to a Survey,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/limiting-answer-choices/,"Limiting Responses to a Survey | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Sending Surveys Collector & Response Options Limiting Responses to a Survey SurveyMonkey Limiting Responses to a Survey You can turn on Response Limits to automatically close your survey once a certain number of respondents have taken the survey through the collector. This was previously called the Maximum Response Count. TIP! Use this collector setting to help manage overall account response limits . You can set this on each collector you use. Turning on the Collector Option If you have multiple collectors, you need to turn on Response Limits for each one separately in order to fully close the survey. To set a survey-wide limit, we suggest using only one collector for your survey. To turn on Response Limits: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector and access the collector options . You may need to click Show advanced options . Turn on Response Limits . Enter the maximum number of responses you want. Click Edit ""survey closed"" message . Once the maximum is reached, anyone who tries to access the survey will see your closed message . TIP! If you don't see this particular option your collector, be sure to also check out the help article about the collector type you're using. You can also set limits on a particular questions by using quotas . How do collector response limits work? All responses (with any responses status ) counts towards your responses limit. You may receive one or a couple responses over the maximum because any respondent in the process of taking the survey when the maximum is reached is still able to submit it. For example, let's say the maximum is set as 100 and you already have 99 responses recorded. If two people access the survey simultaneously, the first person to finish is the 100th respondent. The other respondent will still be able to complete the survey, which means the survey will collect a total of 101 responses. If you're using both Response Limits and a Cutoff Date and Time , whichever comes first will close the collector.

SurveyMonkey Can respondents print their responses? Printing Proof of Completion Exports Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free No, respondents can't print a record of their answers after they complete a survey. However, if you allow respondents to edit responses , they can go back to review or change their responses. As the survey creator, you can export and print a PDF of an individual response in the Analyze Results section. Depending on your situation, you might consider creating a form instead of a survey to collect the data you need. Forms are useful for collecting information and keeping a record for both the form creator and the respondent themselves—whereas a survey is best for collecting feedback and making decisions based on aggregated results. For example, think of an order form—customers want to keep a record of what they ordered, and the company needs to keep a record of the response to follow through with the delivery. With Wufoo , an online form builder, you can set up confirmation emails so that respondents automatically receive an email with all their answers, and any custom message you'd like to include along with that. Printing Proof of Completion There's no way to automatically generate a certificate of completion for respondents, but there are two alternatives: Send your survey via Email Invitation to track respondents and their response status, so you can know who completed your survey. Host a certificate of completion on your own website (or an image-hosting site), and edit the Survey End Page option to redirect respondents to that URL after they complete your survey.

Zendesk Automation lets you send customers a survey automatically after a ticket’s status changes in Zendesk. It’s designed for CX leaders who use Zendesk to manage customer experience across support and success touchpoints. Before You Start Before using Zendesk Automation, go to Integrations (under your settings in Insights) and add a Zendesk connection. Learn more about connecting to Zendesk When you’re done, return to Zendesk Automation in GetFeedback Direct to complete the following steps: Complete Zendesk Details Build your automation in the Live version of your survey. When you publish your survey, any Draft settings will be erased and can’t be recovered. Your Draft settings won't be published to the Live email. You’ll need to set both a draft connection (for your draft survey ) and a live connection (for your live survey) before you can proceed. If you’d like, you can use the same Zendesk connection for both. To set your connections, go to your survey and select Settings . Once this is done, return to Zendesk Automation and confirm that the connections selected for your draft and live automations are the ones you want to use. In the dropdown Object that triggers your survey , select Ticket . Add Zendesk Placeholders Placeholders pull in data from Zendesk, such as agent name (assignee) or ticket type. Add placeholders from Zendesk to help you: analyze response data with custom filtered views (such as creating dashboards per agent) personalize email content trigger follow-up actions and notifications inside GetFeedback Complete Email Details To complete your email template, add the following details: Recipient name . Select Requester Name or Requester First Name . Recipient email . Select Requester Email . Subject . Enter a subject line for your email. After you add Zendesk placeholders, selecting this field will reveal a Personalize option to help you add specific placeholders, such as Requester First Name or Title. Call to action .

Enter an email Subject line that’s clear and concise. Enter your Sender name . This is the name that displays in the From field on the email. Select your Sender email . This includes two parts: Your company, brand, or account name . This should be anything that’s easily recognizable to your customers, such as the name of your company or “support.” Learn more about complying with spam policies Your email domain . You can select one of our default domains or your own custom domain. If you use the default address, the reply-to address will be your GetFeedback login email, and people may be able to see and reply to your personal address. If you use a custom email domain, you can use the Sender email as the reply-to address. Select your custom domain, then check the box to set your custom email address as the reply-to address. Learn how to request a custom domain Don't use accented characters (such as é or á) in the account name. Special characters will cause the email to fail. Don’t add the email domain to the account name (such as @getfeedback.com). You’ll select the domain after entering a name. If you add the domain to the name, your email will fail. Allow recipients to access the survey for . Set how long you’d like the recipient to be able to view and take the survey. To make sure mappings are successful, choose a time frame that’s shorter than the time it takes your Zendesk tickets to change from solved to closed . By default, your Zendesk tickets close after 4 days . You can change this to up to 28 days in Zendesk Admin Center. Add Email Content You can further personalize your email template by adding optional content: Add a logo . Upload an image to appear at the top of your email. Add an optional greeting . Personalize your greeting with placeholders, such as the recipient’s first name. Add an optional message . Personalize your opening message with placeholders, such as the ID of the Zendesk ticket. Add an optional footer message and links . Enter custom footer text and links, such as to your privacy policy or terms of use. Select Save and continue . Now, you’ll need to finish the setup in Zendesk. Finish Your Setup in Zendesk In your Zendesk account, set up your webhook and create an automation or trigger to send your surveys. You’ll need the endpoint URL and JSON provided when you set up your email in GetFeedback. Triggers fire immediately after conditions are met, and automations use a delay . You can use either a trigger or automation to send your survey. Create a Zendesk webhook. Ask your admin to create a webhook in Zendesk using the endpoint URL provided. This webhook talks to GetFeedback, telling GetFeedback when it’s time to send your survey. Make sure to change the request method to POST . Leave the request format as JSON . For authentication, select None . When Zendesk sends data back to our webhook, it includes a unique identifier for your survey. No additional authentication is needed. Skip the option to test the connection. Select Create at the bottom. Select Complete Setup . Select Leave without connecting . The connection will be established in Step 2. Create a Zendesk trigger or automation. Copy the JSON and share it with your admin so they can connect your active webhook to a support trigger or automation . The trigger or automation monitors for changes to your Zendesk tickets. When certain conditions are met, it notifies the webhook, which alerts GetFeedback that it’s time to send your survey. Both triggers and automations serve the same purpose, but automations introduce a delay. For triggers: Under Meet ALL of the following conditions , select Add condition . Then select Status , Changed to , and Solved from the dropdowns. Add a second condition of the same type by selecting Status , Less than , and Closed from the dropdowns. If you’d like, you can add more conditions to only send surveys to certain types of customers or tickets. Under Actions , select Add action . Then select Notify active webhook , as well as the webhook that you created in Step 1. In the JSON body, paste the JSON you copied from GetFeedback. For automations: Under Meet all of the following conditions , add a condition by selecting Ticket: Status , Less than , and Closed from the dropdowns. Select + and add a second condition by selecting Ticket: Hours since solved , Is , and 24 (or your preferred delay, in hours). If you’d like, you can add more conditions to only send surveys to certain types of customers or tickets. Under Perform these actions , select Notifications: Notify active webhook . Then select the webhook that you created in Step 1. In the JSON body, paste the JSON you copied from GetFeedback. Troubleshooting Emails Not Sending If you set up your automation but your survey isn’t being sent, you may need to change your settings in GetFeedback or Zendesk. There are a few things you can do to understand the problem: Check your email in GetFeedback. In Zendesk Automation, make sure you have a placeholder for Recipient name and Recipient email . If these placeholders are missing, GetFeedback may not be able to find the person to send the survey to. If your email is set up correctly, you may need to check your automation and webhook in Zendesk. If you created an automation in Zendesk to send your survey, check the automation criteria in Zendesk. Automations run once every hour. If it has been less than an hour since the conditions were met, you may need to wait for the automation to fire. On the Automations page, check the Usage column to see how many times your automation has run. If the number is 0, you may need to fix your automation to make it run. Open your automation and select Preview match for the conditions above. If the conditions don’t match any tickets, they may be too strict. Try adjusting the conditions to make sure your conditions match the tickets you want. If your automation is working, check the webhook in Zendesk. Go to your webhook’s Activity log and check the Response Status. If the status is Failed, you may need to adjust your webhook. If everything is set up correctly but surveys still aren’t being sent, contact us .

Check the survey to confirm what questions/pages have logic and which page it is jumping respondents over. Begin in the Analyze section by selecting to view all pages. (That option is located in the upper left side of the Response Summary page, to the right of the left sidebar.) Any respondent that has been jumped according to the logic will have blank pages. If the respondent was never directed to that page, then that respondent was never able to answer those questions. Pages further along in the design will have their answers on the questions if the respondent was directed to them. If instead a person just exited early, the rest of his/her response will be blank when viewing the survey. Logic isn't activating on questions Skip Logic is only activated when you click Next to go the following page of the survey, so Skip Logic will not be dynamically activated on the same page. We always suggest placing Skip Logic questions at the end of a page for this reason. Once you click Next to the advance through the survey, you'll find that the logic does activate successfully. Logic on Checkbox and Image Choice (multiple answers) questions not working Skip Logic must always work in a 1:1 ratio, meaning there's no way to take multiple conditions into consideration before leading a respondent down a certain logic path. Checkbox and Image Choice (Multiple Answers Allowed) question types do allow Skip Logic, but keep in mind that if several choices with logic applied are selected, the system will only refer to the first selection to determine where to send the respondent next. Skip Logic skips to the wrong question number Skip Logic automatically renumbers survey questions based on each respondent's specific logic path. Avoid referring to question numbers in the question text itself, since the numbers may be different for every respondent. Tips for Successful Skip Logic : Always move respondents forward through a survey by adding skip logic questions at the end of a page. Make sure to preview and test your skip logic to ensure that each logic path is set up correctly.

GetFeedback gives you multiple ways to view and analyze your app feedback. Use the dashboard to get an overview of your users and their feedback. Use the Feedback page to dive deeper into app feedback. Before You Start Make sure you’re in the Apps section of GetFeedback. In app.usabilla.com , go to the top left corner below the GetFeedback logo. If you see Websites or Email, select the dropdown, then select Apps . Viewing Feedback Overview in the Dashboard The App feedback dashboard gives you a high-level overview of the feedback coming in through your application. To view your dashboard, select Dashboard from the left-side menu. Filter options Select Filter by in the top right corner to filter your feedback by: Date : Data range of the feedback. By default, the dashboard shows the last 30 days. Form : the feedback form the respondent used to provide feedback. Platform : Android or iOS. App : the app version used when feedback was given. General Graphs The 3 overview graphs provide a quick overview of app performance. These graphs represent the average emotional score, feedback item frequency, and NPS score (if you’re collecting NPS). Emotional Trendline The Emotional Trendline shows a timeline of the average mood rating. Hover over the data points to see a breakdown per day. Feedback Items The Feedback items graph shows you the number of incoming items per day over the date range you specified. Hover over the individual days to see the number of feedback items submitted on that day. If your selected date range is longer than 30 days, the graph shows feedback items by week. Net Promotor Score In-app feedback tends to be negative, so we don't recommend comparing in-app NPS scores to NPS scores from other sources. If at least one of your forms contains a Net Promoter Score (NPS) question, you also have an NPS Trendline and score breakdown chart. Technical Metadata The next chart shows information about the devices that respondents sent feedback from. This information is collected whenever a user submits feedback through the feedback form in your app. You will find the average mood score for each of the available specifications as well as the number of feedback items that have been submitted. This breakdown helps you see if users are having more problems on specific devices or operating systems. The metadata chart lets you view: App version (this is specified by your developers in the implementation of GetFeedback Digital for Apps) OS version (for example, iOS 14.5) Device (for example, iPhone or iPad) Manufacturer (for example, Samsung or Apple) Device Language The device language is the language set in the respondent’s device specifications. This chart also shows the number of items sent and the average mood score for each language. Label You can add labels on the feedback page to group your feedback, mark the item’s status, or assign the item to a specific team member. The dashboard chart shows you the labels used on your feedback items and their average mood score. Geographical Engagement The geographical engagement tile tells you where your users left feedback. The location is based on the user's IP address and segmented per country. If your users left feedback in the United States, you can also view feedback per state. View Detailed Feedback When you start collecting feedback through your app, you can view and analyze responses on the Feedback page in real time. You can filter your feedback to look at specific scores, labels, device types, and more. Access the Feedback page To view feedback in real time, select Feedback from the left-side menu. Filtering Panel Use the filtering panel on the left side of the screen to view feedback by score, date, device type, and more. You can filter feedback by: Forms : The feedback form respondents submitted Date : Date or range when respondents gave feedback Status : Status of the feedback, either new, read, archived, or starred Mood : The mood rating given NPS : The NPS score given (if available) Labels : The labels assigned to feedback Device : The device that respondents sent feedback from Os Version : The operating system that the respondent used to send feedback App version : The app version that respondents sent feedback from When you apply a filter, you can bookmark the URL to visit the filtered view later, or you can copy it to share with colleagues. Trendline charts At the top of the screen, the trendline charts give you an overview of the feedback you received. The charts shown depend on the data you’ve collected. Emotional trendline : Average mood rating results over time Frequency trendline : Number of feedback items received per day NPS : Breakdown of your average NPS Device chart : Percentage of feedback items per device Operating System Chart : Percentage of feedback items per OS By default, the charts show results for the last 30 days.

However, we understand that some customers prefer EU data storage. Also, closer data storage is likely to improve site speed for survey creation and survey-taking. We offer some Enterprise customers the ability to store survey and response data in the EU Data Center in Ireland, using our public cloud infrastructure. Other data, such as login information, billing details, and account metadata may be stored in the United States. When creating the account, the Primary Admin can request that we store the team's survey and response data in the EU. This setting applies to all users added to the team. At this time, existing customers aren’t able to choose to migrate their data to the EU data center. Logging in to SurveyMonkey on the EU Data Center To log in to your SurveyMonkey account, go to eu.sur v eymonkey.com . It’s a good idea to bookmark the home page since it’s unique for customers storing data in the EU. On the SurveyMonkey Mobile App, use the Europe region link to log in to the European Data Center.

Page Skip Logic,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/page-skip-logic/,"Page Skip Logic | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview Adding Logic Page Options Details Troubleshooting Help Creating Surveys Applying Logic Page Skip Logic SurveyMonkey Page Skip Logic Video Overview Adding Logic Page Options Details Troubleshooting Question and Page Skip Logic Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free You can apply Page Skip Logic to a page so that everyone that reaches the page is skipped to a specific destination later in the survey—like a later page or the end of the survey. Unlike Question Skip Logic , Page Skip Logic doesn't depend on respondents' answers to specific questions—it's simply activated when a respondent reaches that page, and clicks Next. If you have the Advanced Branching feature instead, it replaces Page Skip Logic, so you'll need to use Advanced Branching instead to achieve the same effect. Video Overview Adding Logic To add Page Logic: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. At the top of the survey page, click the Page Logic button. Select Page skip logic from the menu. If you don't see this option, you may have Advanced Branching instead, which replaces Page Skip Logic. Choose one of the page options (described below). To remove Page Skip Logic, follow the above steps to open the Page Skip Logic tab. Then click Clear from the right of the blue bar. Test your logic! Preview the survey to test all possible logic paths before sending it out. Responses aren't recorded when previewing. Page Options You can choose one of the following pages to send respondents to: Any page number - This will skip respondents to the designated page. You must move respondents forward through the survey, and not backward. End of Survey - This will send respondents directly to the end of the survey, which will activate the Survey End Page you specified in the collector options. Their response will be considered COMPLETE when you view their individual response in the Analyze Results section. Disqualify Respondent - This will send respondents to a disqualification page. You can customize the disqualification page in the Collector Options. Their response will be considered DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response in the Analyze Results section. Details Skip Logic takes effect when a respondent clicks the Next button to advance through the survey. Question Skip Logic overrides Page Skip Logic if both are applied on the same page. It's important to only move respondents forward in a survey—if you send respondents backwards, it could create an endless loop and prevent them from completing the survey. When Skip Logic is applied, we automatically renumber question and page numbers, if you have numbering turned on . Troubleshooting Read more about troubleshooting Skip Logic issues .

Return to Work Solutions,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/return-to-work/,"Return to Work Solutions | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Designing Your Survey Sending Your Survey Analyzing & Sharing Results Help Creating Surveys Survey Use Cases & Templates Solutions COVID-19 Return to Work Solutions SurveyMonkey Return to Work Solutions Designing Your Survey Sending Your Survey Analyzing & Sharing Results ENTERPRISE FEATURE: Return to Work Solutions are only available for English surveys. If you're interested, contact sales . If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager. Return to Work solutions are a way for HR leaders to understand employees’ feelings about working remotely, returning to work, and working in shared spaces. Start with an editable survey template with guided setup, decide how frequently you want to send the survey out, and access automatically created reports with insights from your results. Designing Your Survey The first thing you’ll do is create your survey in the Design Survey section. Review the survey template and add any customizations you need, using the Genius Assistant to help guide you through the design process. 1️⃣ Design the Survey Log into your SurveyMonkey account. From Home , find a template in the Recent Surveys section. There are three Return to Work templates: Remote worker engagement Returning to workplace Onsite worker engagement Click Get started , and look for the Genius Assistant's prompts to help you customize the survey. The first question in the survey is called the Anchor Question. Responses to the Anchor Question are used as part of the insights available in the Analysis section–you'll see an alert if you try to make changes that invalidate the automatic insights. You can update the rest of the survey's demographic questions to match your organization's needs. 2️⃣ Preview the Survey Preview your survey to make sure everything works the way you expect it to. You can take the survey and make sure the correct message displays based on your answers. If something doesn't look right, go back to the Design section and make changes. Sending Your Survey When you're ready to send your survey, you can choose any collector type . For recurring surveys that will get sent to the same group of people, we recommend using the email invitation collector . You can customize the invitation, track who has responded, set automated reminders for people to fill out the survey, and set it up to re-send on specific days and times. 3️⃣ Add Your Contact List If you're using the Email Invitation collector, create a contact list to make sure the right people get the survey. This also gives you more control over your recipient list because you can add and remove people as needed. 4 ️⃣ Set Up an Email Invitation Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Choose Email . Click Add Contacts . Click Contacts . Choose the group you want to send the survey to and click Add . Customize the Message section and write what you want people to see when they open the invitation. Click Next . (Optional) Choose any collector options . If you want people to get a copy of their responses, turn Email Results On. Click Next . 5️⃣ Make your Survey Recurring To automatically send the survey to the same group more than once, select recurring email . Then, choose the time and dates you want the survey to be sent. The actual time that your recurring emails will be sent is determined by the time zone selected in My Account . When you use a recurring email, it creates a new message and automatically resends the survey to the same group. You'll see the new messages, called occurrences, in the same collector. If you add or remove people from your contact list, new messages will be sent to the most up-to-date list. Analyzing & Sharing Results Once you’ve collected responses, it’s time to analyze your results. You can filter your data, export your results, and share ready-made dashboards with insights pulled from your responses. 6️⃣ Analyzing Your Results By default, when you go to the Analyze Results section of the survey, we’ll display responses collected since your last invite. Once you send out your recurring survey, you can find automatically created Saved Views in the left section of the sidebar that correspond with each occurance. Click the name of a View to turn it on or off, and view the responses associated with it. 7️⃣ Creating a Results Dashboard Results Dashboards are a way to easily share your survey results with others. When you create a Results Dashboard for a Return to Work survey, we use machine learning to show you any statistically significant data in the Insights Summary section at the top of your dashboard. The Insights Summary may include the following: Trend Chart: high-level trends from the Anchor Question over time. This chart is only available when you use the recurring email collector. Dashboard Insights: Statistically significant differences between demographics you surveyed Benchmarks: Results to your anchor-question compared across other organizations To create a Results Dashboard: Make sure you're in the Analyze Results section. At the top of the page, click View in Dashboard . You'll find any available automatic insights at the top of the dashboard, followed by charts from up to 20 of your compatible survey questions. Before you publish and share your dashboard , you can customize the layout by moving around cards, or adding text to give more context to your results. 8️⃣ Exporting Your Results Learn more: Exporting Survey Results Related Articles Scoring Your Survey Measure Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with SurveyMonkey Accepting Payments with PayPal English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

OAuth: Best Practices,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/oauth-best-practices/,"OAuth: Best Practices | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Invited Users Mapping to Custom Fields Contact Details Help Advanced Features OAuth: Best Practices Apply OAuth: Best Practices Invited Users Mapping to Custom Fields Contact Details Invited Users Invited users (recommenders, collaborators) will sign in through native login as there is no guarantee that the SSO-related email address will be used. These types of users should access the site through their invited email or through the SurveyMonkey Apply Log In button. Administrators without an SSO account login can still sign in to the site through the SM Apply login. To access the sign-on page you can also add /admin/ to the end of the site's URL. For example: testsite.Apply.com/admin/ Mapping to Custom Fields If you are looking to bring information through the SSO to populate custom fields on Apply, there are a few things to note. First, custom fields should be created in Apply before the SSO is configured. This way, you will know the exact titles of the custom fields. In the SSO configuration, Apply checks the name of the property against what Custom Fields are in the site, and the Custom Field is populated. In the event that the Custom Field is not an exact match to the property you are sending over, a new Custom Field will be created. For example, if you pass us “address”, but the custom field on Apply is “Address”, a new custom field will be created. Therefore, ensure the properties you are passing are an exact match to the Apply custom field. Custom Fields are often used in Automations or Piping, which is why it is best practice to create them beforehand instead of creating them through the SSO. This ensures the piping variable or custom field can be used during the configuration of your Apply site and stays consistent throughout. Custom Fields have a character limit of 512 characters . Therefore, you won't be able to pass through fields that have characters over this limit. Contact Details Key contact details for the main individual implementing the SSO integration on your end should be provided to your Implementation Specialist.

With Organization registration enabled in your site, Members of the same Organization can seamlessly work together on applications to submit the application under their Organizations name. This article will provide a brief overview of the feature and how to configure it within your site. Organization Profiles: Overview Organization Profiles allow users to register to your site and apply to programs on behalf of an organization. Depending on your preference applicants accessing your site can choose to register as an Individual, an Organization, or Both. If applicants are able to register as both within the site, you can also configure the individual programs to only be available to one or the other, or both options. When registering, applicants will be asked for basic information about the organization they are applying for, to allow you as a site administrator to gain a better sense of who is registering. When an applicant registers for an Organization, they will be considered the Primary Organization Administrator. They will also be able to add additional members to create and manage applications on behalf of an organization. Within an organization there can be three different types of members: Member Type Description Primary Administrator This member will have full administrative control over the organization's members and applications. The initial creator of the organization will be made the Primary Administrator by default. However, they will be able to transfer ownership of the organization. They will also be able to edit and remove members of the organization at any time. They will also be the primary contact for that organization. Organization Administrator These members have similar control over the organization's members and applications as the Primary Administrator. However, they will only be able to edit and remove non-administrative members, or inactive Organization Administrators. Non-Administrative Members These members will be able to edit applications on behalf of the organization but will not have access to manage the organization's profile and members. They will also not be able to create or submit applications for an organization. How to Setup Organizations How to Enable Organization Registration If you wish to allow your applicants to register as an Organization, or as an Organization or Individual: Click on Settings Go to Registration Under Registrants, click on the dropdown for Registrant Restrictions Select the restriction you wish to set: Restriction Description Individuals Only Registered Users can access site material only as an Individual Organizations Only Registered Users can access site material only as a member of an Organization Individuals and Organizations Registered Users can access site materials both as a member of an organization or as an individual. Optional: Enable Require tax numbers for organizations that register . i. Choose what format of tax number(s) your users might register with based on the countries they reside in. ii. Click Done. When enabled this will be required for all organizations. If you wish to make this optional consider adding an Organization Custom field . Click Save How to Configure Programs for Organizations and/or Individuals If you have set up your registration to allow for Both Organizations and Individuals, you can configure each program in your site based on who can apply to the organization. To configure these settings: Go to your Program Settings Go to the Applications tab Under Restrict Applications , select who can apply for the program: Individuals Only, Organizations Only, Individuals and Organizations Click Save & Exit How to Implement Organization Custom Fields Setting up Custom Fields for your organization is the same as creating Custom Fields for Applicants, Reviewers, and Recommenders . However, the selected Target will be Organizations . TIP! Use Custom Fields to collect additional information about the organization that the SurveyMonkey Apply registration form does not already collect. How to Add and Manage Organizations As the site Administrator, you will be able to add organizations individually or in bulk from the Manage Users section of the site. After you have added the organization, the primary organization administrator will need to be invited to the organization in order to complete the Organization Profile before the organization will appear visible on their applicant account. How to Add Organizations Once you have enabled organizations in your site, organizations can either register themselves, or you can manually add them. Manually adding organizations will allow you to add the organization’s name, and the name and email of the primary administrator of the organization. To add an organization to the site. Go to Manage Users Click on Add Organization in the top right corner Enter the Organization Name , and the First Name , Last Name , and Email Address of Primary Administrator for that organization. Recommended: Select Notify user by email that they have been added. When adding the organization, the primary administrator will need to be invited to the organization in order to complete the organization profile. Optional: Enter applicable Organization Custom Fields Click Add Organization An email can still be sent to invite the primary administrator at a later date (after they have been added). For more information see How to Invite a Primary Admin to the Organization How to Import Organizations in Bulk In some cases, you may need to add multiple organizations to your site at one time. If this is the case, you can use the Import Organizations feature of the site. To upload users in bulk: Go to Manage Users Click on Add Organization in the top right corner Click Import Users Select Download Template . If you have custom fields in the site these fields will also be added as columns to the template. Populate the Template with all the relevant information of the users ensuring that Organization name, Primary Admin First Name, Primary Admin Last Name, and Primary Admin Email are filled as these are required fields Once you have saved the file on your computer, select Choose File under Upload your populated organization template: Choose what you would like to do with Duplicate Entries (refer to the available options below) Recommended: Select Notify user by email that they have been added. When adding the organization, the primary administrator will need to be invited to the organization in order to complete the organization profile. Optional: Select Include a custom message in the email to send a quick message including the reasoning for inviting them to the site. The same message will be sent to all users in the CSV file. Uploading Duplicate Entries If the primary administrator already exists within your site, you can select how you would like to treat duplicates that may exist in your import. The options you can choose from are: Action Description Skip If there is an email address in the import that already exists in your site, the upload will completely skip over this user, and no further information will be updated. Overwrite Existing Fields In some cases, information may have changed for your users. With this option, if the site recognizes a duplicate it will use the information in the upload to overwrite the information that exists in the site. Update Missing Fields This option means that if the field was not completed previously then it will be updated. This can be useful if you add a new custom field and only wish to update that field for users. How to Manage Organizations Once you have added your Organizations to the site you can manage them as an administrator. In most cases, the Organizations will be managed by the Members that are apart of the organization. However, as a Site Administrator, you can perform these actions on behalf of the organization as well. NOTE: You will not be able to add or remove members to or from an organization, this can only be done by the Administrators of the Organization. To Manage an organization: Go to Manage Users Click on the Organizations tab This will provide you with a full list of the Organizations that have applied to your site, as well as a few details about the Organization including the email address of the Primary Administrator. How to Email Members of the Organization Go to Manage Users Click on the Organizations tab Select the organization you wish to contact Click on the Email icon Select if you wish to email the Organization primary administrators or All Organization Members Compose your email Click Send Now How to Invite a Primary Admin to the Organization Go to Manage Users Click on the Organizations tab Select the organization you wish to contact Click on the More Option Icon and show the Organization in Full Screen Go to the Members tab Select the Primary Administrator Click Actions Click Send Invite This will send the primary administrator an invitation to the organization to allow them to log in, complete the registration process and fill out the rest of the Organization Profile.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. You need to have the Salesforce integration to use Lightning Flows. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitations : Lightning Flows and Components aren't available to customers storing data in the EU data center and the integration setup is only available in English. If you use our Salesforce integration and use Salesforce Lightning Experience, you have access to our Lightning flows and Lightning Components. The Lightning flow lets Salesforce users take or send in-the-moment surveys directly from Account, Contact, or Lead objects. Salesforce users can take a survey within Salesforce, for example, to provide feedback that a customer gave a rep over the phone. The SurveyMonkey Lightning Component lets Salesforce users send a survey to one or more Contacts off the Case or Contact objects, or to a Lead off any other object. A common use case is to send ad-hoc surveys to Contacts in Salesforce related to an Case. The Survey Response Visualization Lightning component lets you see the responses from the survey that were completed via the component or flow. Response data is stored in SurveyMonkey Response records, which are related to the object the survey was sent from. Set up Lightning Flows Use the SurveyMonkey Setup Assistant from the App menu to set up your System Connections and create and manage survey sets for Lightning Flows. Users need permission to set up Lightning pages and Lightning setup—contact your Salesforce administrator if you need assistance. To set up your System Connections and Lightning Flow Management: In Salesforce, click the App Launcher icon. Click SurveyMonkey Setup . In the Setup Assistant , click Get Started next to System Connections . Click Authorize and follow the instructions to set up a connection to Salesforce. Click Next .

Send Surveys via SurveyMonkey Lightning Component Sending the survey from the component creates a new email invitation collector to send the survey and it uses default SurveyMonkey branding. To add the component: Go to a record for the object you want to add the SurveyMonkey flow to send or take surveys. Click Setup (the gear icon). Click Edit Page . Scroll down to the Custom—Managed Components section. Drag and drop the SurveyMonkey and/or Survey Response Visualization components where you want them on the page layout. Click Save .

Sum If you enter a number in this field, then all fields on the text response grid must add up to that number. If you wish to simply sum the Values in the grid you will need to enter a dash ""-"" in the field beside Sum in order to total the values entered. Entering any value in this field will cause the Total row to appear. NOTE: This field cannot be pulled into a report. If you require the SUM of this column to be included in a report we would recommend setting up a SUM Function using Advanced Expression Piping . Sum Label By default, this option is ""The values of column: {x} should add up to {y}. Currently: {z}"" Restore Initial Value When a user comes back to this form page, this question will have its default value. TIP! Use this if you are using Piping Variables within the question, it will ensure that the variable will look for the most up-to-date value.

By default, this option is blank. Sum Label This label will appear underneath the Row Labels when you have the entered a value in the Sum field. Display side-by-side Display this question side by side with another question. This will need to be enabled on the other question as well. Append to previous question This question type appends to the question before it to make it appear that they are connected within the form. NOTE: Any Branching Logic , such as to hide or show the previous question, will also apply to this question. However, the requirement settings won't be.

Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Object in Salesforce,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-mapping-multiple-surveys/,"Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Object in Salesforce | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Building Page Layouts Creating Record Types Help Salesforce Salesforce Field Mapping Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Object in Salesforce GetFeedback Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Object in Salesforce Building Page Layouts Creating Record Types Essentials feature : Available on Essentials, Ultimate, and Pro plans. The Salesforce integration allows you to map GetFeedback survey data to Salesforce custom objects. However, if you map multiple surveys to the same custom object, you may end up with blank fields and missing information on your custom object. You can adjust your object’s page layout to make sure your mapped data displays correctly. To organize a custom object, you can create Record Types in Salesforce. Record types are like mini page layouts, where certain fields can be hidden from view depending on the chosen layout. For this example, we'll map 3 surveys into the same custom object. These surveys will be called “Customer Service Feedback,” “Trip Feedback,” and “Case Closure.” Building Page Layouts First, you’ll need to create a few page layouts in Salesforce for your custom object. A “primary layout” that includes every field you’ve added. A separate layout for each survey you’re mapping to the object. Each layout should contain only the fields you’re mapping that survey to. Creating Record Types After creating your page layouts, create a record type for each page layout. From Setup in Salesforce, go to your object, then select Record Types . When creating the record types: You’ll need to select an existing record type to create a new one. If you don’t have any, you can use the Master type. Make the record type available for any profile that has access to your survey data. You don’t have to check the Active box yet, but the layouts won’t work until you activate them. On the second page, select the page layout to use for your record type. Repeat the process to create a record type for each page layout you created. Choosing a Record Type in GetFeedback Finally, map responses from your survey to the appropriate record types in Salesforce. To choose record types in GetFeedback: From your app.getfeedback.com survey, select Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings . Create a new mapping for your custom object. For Record Type , select the record type you created that matches your survey. Repeat for each survey you’re mapping to the custom object. Once you create your mappings, submit a few test survey responses to make sure the responses display correctly in your Record Types.

How to Concatenate Values in a Form (CONCAT),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/concat-values/,"How to Concatenate Values in a Form (CONCAT) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the CONCAT Function? Proper Formatting for CONCAT Expressions Limitations of the CONCAT Function Help Advanced Features How to Concatenate Values in a Form (CONCAT) Apply How to Concatenate Values in a Form (CONCAT) What is the CONCAT Function? Proper Formatting for CONCAT Expressions Limitations of the CONCAT Function Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. This article will explain the process of using the CONCAT function to concatenate (merge) values into one cell in a form. What is the CONCAT Function? The CONCAT function accepts a list of floating or integer values and merges each of the values together into a single integer. This can either be used for a single row or column within a grid question, the table as a whole or a list of variables within the form. An example use case of the CONCAT Function, would be if for reporting purposes, you want to report on the area codes of a phone number, therefore you have the applicants enter the area code in separate test response field then the rest of the phone number. Within a hidden field in the form you could then use the CONCAT function to concatenate the area code with the rest of the phone number in order to have the entire number in one field. Proper Formatting for CONCAT Expressions The setup and formatting of the CONCAT expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the CONCAT expression should be set up as follows: {{ CONCAT(variable1,variable2) }} No spaces or commas will be added to separate the original values. Therefore if you wish to concatenate four cells that have 1, 2, 3, 4 the CONCAT function will present this as 1234. CONCAT Operation CONCAT Expression Result CONCAT Select Cells {{ CONCAT(q1[0],q1[2],q1[3]) }} Based on Grid Indexing , this will merge the 1st, 3rd, and 4th cells. CONCAT a Column {{ CONCAT(q1[:0]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will merge all values in Column 1. CONCAT a Row {{ CONCAT(q2[1:]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will merge all values in Row 2. CONCAT a Range {{ CONCAT(q1[0:4]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will merge the first 4 cells. CONCAT Reviewer Scores {{ CONCAT(q1.score,q2.score,q3.score) }} Concatenate the scores given to the included questions. Limitations of the CONCAT Function The CONCAT function would not be able to perform any operations using an expression such as addition (+) nor would it be possible to have other functions within a single CONCAT function such as SUM to calculate the different variables together to then find the smallest value. If you are planning on using fields that are created through expression piping, you will need to perform the function on one page and then pipe those fields into the next page using the CONCAT function.

This helps restrict your form to only allow one entry per person, but it's not foolproof. Keep in mind: If the same person were to access your form from another computer, they'd be able to submit another entry. It's common for businesses and universities to have multiple people on the same IP address. Using this setting will only allow one person to fill out the form if they share an IP address. To allow only one entry per IP address: Log in and go to Forms . Click the form you want to edit. In the Form Builder, click the Form Settings tab.

If elements being referenced on the page aren't served over SSL, like the logo on your form, people trying to access your form may see a browser warning that says they're trying to access unsecured content.

Advanced Branching lets you customize the behavior of your survey based on multiple conditions and it's one of our most powerful logic features . Build conditions based on a respondent's answers, custom data from Contacts , custom variables , or survey language. When the criteria you define in your conditions are met, you can skip respondents to future points in your survey, show or hide questions, show or hide pages, or invalidate questions and customize the error message. Add unconditional skip logic to a page, so that everyone that reaches that page is skipped to a specific page later in the survey. For example, you can have respondents select only the products they’ve purchased from a list of options and then show them follow up questions relevant to those products while hiding the follow up questions on products they didn’t purchase. Or, you can disqualify respondents who answer a series of questions in a certain way, so you can screen out respondents that aren't relevant to your survey's goals. TIP! It's best to apply Advanced Branching after your survey design is finalized. Video Overview Survey Requirements Before adding Advanced Branching to your survey, it's helpful to understand what data you can base conditions on, and what collector types you'll need to use in order for everything to work smoothly. Data Description Compatible Collector Types Questions Any question type except Text, Image, Click Map, Text A/B Test, Question A/B test, and Image A/B Test.

If no other skip rules apply, proceed to this page... Unconditional Skip Rule An unconditional rule composed of an action only. Order of Rules and Conflicts When a respondent submits a page in your survey, all the rules on that page are evaluated in order from top to bottom. If you use multiple types of rules together, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Unconditional Skip Rule If two or more rules of the same type conflict with one another, we take action on the first rule in the list, and ignore any subsequent rules that conflict with it. Using Advanced Branching with Question Skip Logic While you can use Question Skip Logic and Advanced Branching on the same survey, we suggest using Advanced Branching exclusively so you can manage all of your logic in one place and better avoid conflicts. If you do use Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic together, and there's a conflict between the two types of logic, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Question Skip Logic > Unconditional Skip Rule. For example, if you have an Advanced Branching Rule and Question Skip Logic based on the exact same condition, the Advanced Branching Rule takes precedence. Conditions & Actions Creating rules is as easy as creating logical sentences based on questions in your survey, or information about your respondent. Every rule is made up of two parts: a condition and an action. You can build rules based on the following subjects. Keep in mind that some subjects will only work when you use a certain collector type to send your survey. Expand | Collapse Conditions Conditions define the fields you want to base the rule on, and how you want us to evaluate those fields. Conditions are made up of three parts: Part Description Example Subject The data you want to base the rule on. Q4: What is your age? Operator Tells us how to evaluate the subject's value to make the condition true. You can use several different operators to define the relationship between the subject and the value. is one of Value The value of the subject you're basing the rule on. This could be the answer choice the respondent selected, the open-ended response they type into your survey, or the data that we know about them already from Contacts , Custom Variables , or survey language. 17 or younger 18-20 21-29 Adding Multiple Conditions to a Rule You can add multiple conditions to a rule and use the Boolean operators OR or AND to define the relationship between the conditions. Within a single advanced branching rule, you can either use all AND operators, or all OR operators—you can't mix and match. The NOT Boolean operator is not available. Actions Actions define what the survey should do if the conditions are met. There are two types of actions: Branching Actions and Other Actions . Branching Actions let you skip respondents to a later point in the survey when the conditions of your rule are met. Other Actions let you show or hide questions and pages, or invalidate questions when certain conditions are met. Rule Type Action Description Branching Action Skip to page Skip the respondent to a future page in your survey. Branching Action Exit block Skip the respondent to the next available block, if Block Randomization applied. If a block is not available, the respondent will skip to the next available page. Branching Action End survey Skip the respondent to the Survey End Page option. The response is marked as COMPLETE when you view their individual response Branching Action Disqualify respondent Skip the respondent to the disqualification page that you select in the collector options. The response is marked as DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response . Other Actions Hide question Hide a question on a future page in the survey. Questions are shown until the conditions are met. Other Actions Show question Show a question on a future page in the survey. Questions are hidden until the conditions are met. Other Actions Hide page Hide a future page in the survey. Other Actions Show page Show a future page in the survey. Other Actions Invalidate question Invalidate any question on a future page, or the current page, and customize the error message that respondents will see when they try to proceed to the next page of the survey. Managing Existing Rules To view or edit an existing rule: Click the advanced branching icon « at the top of a page to view or edit the rules applied to that page. Click the down arrow to the right of any rule to edit, copy, delete, or move a rule. You can't copy or move rules to another page in the survey. TIP! When you save a rule, we convert it into a script. To understand what an existing rule means, you can hover over the script to see what each piece represents. Previewing & Testing Rules The best way to test Advanced Branching depends on the subjects you based your rules on. At this time there's no way to reference advanced branching rules alongside your survey as you test it. Expand | Collapse Testing Rules Based on Questions If all of the conditions in your survey are based on questions and their responses, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select. Testing Rules Based on Custom Data from Contacts If any of your conditions are based on custom data from Contacts , the best way to test your survey is to create a group in your Contacts and then send an Email Invitation to that group. When you create a test group, include email addresses that you have access to for testing. When you add custom data to those contacts, make sure that you have a test contact for each persona you based your advanced branching rules on. For example, if you use the Custom 1 field to record each contact's department, and you based advanced branching rules on multiple departments, make sure to create a test contact that represents each department. When you compose your invitation message, insert custom data tags into the message so you can refer to the set of custom data you're about to test when you receive the email. After you're done testing, clear and delete the collector to remove the test data from your survey. Testing Rules Based on Custom Variables If any of your conditions are based on custom variables , the best way to test your survey is to create a Web Link and edit the variables in the URL to test different logic paths. Allow multiple responses so you can test the survey several times with different variables. Testing Rules Based on Survey Language If all of the conditions in your survey are based on the survey language, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on survey language. Analyzing Your Results Your results in the Analyze Results section will look the same as any normal survey. If a respondent was skipped past a question or page due to a branching action, or if a question was hidden from a respondent, the questions they didn't see are marked as skipped in the Analyze Results section. There's no way to view or export the logic path that a particular respondent took through your survey. Common Questions Expand | Collapse Can I show or hide questions dynamically on the same page? No. We evaluate the advanced branching rules on a page when a respondent submits that page, so you can only show or hide questions on future pages. Will my rules update if I delete or add more questions and pages? If you delete pages, questions, or answer choices in your survey, advanced branching rules update automatically so you don't need to go back to update them manually. For example, if one of your rules is based on Q1, and then you add a new question before it that becomes the new Q1, the rule will dynamically update to reference Q2 instead. However, we recommend waiting to apply advanced branching rules until after your survey design is complete. It's easier to apply logic once the organization of your survey is finalized. Are values case sensitive? Yes, values are case sensitive. What's the difference between Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic? While Question Skip Logic can only take one action based on one condition (the answer to one closed-ended question), advanced branching logic allows you to take multiple actions based on multiple conditions—including conditions based on open-ended fields.

Multilingual Surveys,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/builder/multilingual-surveys/,"Multilingual Surveys | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Setting a Default Language Adding a Language Adding Translations Enabling the Translated Language Publishing the Survey Manually Creating Surveys in Multiple Languages Help Survey Builder Multilingual Surveys GetFeedback Multilingual Surveys Setting a Default Language Adding a Language Adding Translations Enabling the Translated Language Publishing the Survey Manually Creating Surveys in Multiple Languages Pro feature : Available on Pro and Ultimate plans. The GetFeedback multiple language feature helps you send out one survey translated into many languages for your global audience. Our multiple language functionality lets you create translated surveys and show them to respondents based on their browser’s default language. Once you add a language, you can export your survey text to a CSV or XLSX file, enter the translations, and import the translated text. You can also type translations directly into the survey if it’s easier for your team. However, adding languages doesn’t automatically translate your survey. Translations can’t be added to email invitations. To send separate email invitations for each language, you’ll need to create a separate survey for each language. Some GetFeedback customers on legacy plans may not be able to create multilingual surveys. Supported Languages Learn which languages are supported in GetFeedback How it Works When someone opens your survey, they'll see the version that matches their browser language. They can also select their language from a dropdown on your survey. Create your survey . Set a default survey language. Add the languages you'll add translations for. Enter or import your translations. Enable the translations. Publish your survey. Setting a Default Language The Admin language, which is your survey’s default language, displays at the top of the survey builder. The Admin language displays for all respondents if you don’t enable other languages for your survey. To change the default language: From your survey, select Settings . Under Localization , find Admin language . Choose the language to use as the survey default. Adding a Language Add a language to your survey so you can add translations. The language you add is disabled by default, and we won’t show translations until you enable the language. To add a language to your survey: From your survey, select the Admin language to display the language list. Select the language you want to add. A blank version of your survey displays so you can add translations. Adding Translations There are two ways to add translations: Enter translations directly into the survey. Export a CSV file to add translations to and import. Entering Translations in the Survey Builder Enter the translated question and answer text in the survey builder. When you select a question, the original text will display in the default language. Add Translations Using a CSV or XSLX File Professional translators often prefer to work with a CSV (Comma-Separated Value) file. The CSV contains one column of original text, and one column of translated text. Our survey builder can export and import both CSV and XLSX files. After exporting the CSV file, don’t delete content from your survey or change the original text. Deleting content makes the translation file invalid, and you won’t be able to import the translated file. To add translations using a CSV or XSLX File: Export the survey text: From your survey, select Import Translations . The Export tab is selected by default. Select Download . Look for a file named “translation_xx.csv.” Add translations to the file, or send the file to a translation team. The file has 3 columns: Original text in the default language. Empty column for the translated text. Enter translations in this column. Metadata for GetFeedback . We use this metadata to apply translations to the correct survey components. Don’t delete or alter the data in this column. When you're done editing the file, save it in a CSV or XSLX format using UTF-8 character encoding. Import the file in GetFeedback: From your survey, select Import translations . Select the Import tab. Select Choose File , then select your translated CSV or XLSX file. Select Upload . At the success message, select Continue to view the translations in your survey draft. Enabling the Translated Language From your survey, toggle on the language at the top of the survey builder. This enables the translation when you publish your survey. If your language is disabled, respondents won’t be able to see the survey translations for that language. Instead, the survey will default to your admin language. Adding Other Languages You can add as many languages as you want. Select additional languages from the language list, then follow the steps above to add the translation. Publishing the Survey When you’re done adding translations, publish your survey. The translated versions display for anyone with those languages set as their default browser language. If their browser uses a language you don’t have enabled, they’ll view the default language version of your survey. For example, if you enable a French translation and use English as the default, respondents with French as their default browser language will see the French version. Respondents with Spanish as the browser language will see your default language survey. To override this, the respondent can select the language from the button in the top right corner of the survey. When they select a language, the survey will refresh and display in the new language. Manually Creating Surveys in Multiple Languages Create copies of an app.getfeedback.com survey in multiple languages to get feedback from your global audience. Create and Copy the Default Survey Create your base survey in your default language. You’ll use this survey as the template for each of the translated surveys. After creating your survey, create a copy for each language you’re adding. To create a survey copy: From the app.getfeedback.com home page, select My surveys . Find the survey to copy, then select the three dots . Select Copy . Rename the survey so you can easily find it later. Repeat for each language you’re translating the survey to. Example : If you’re translating from English to French and Spanish, create two copies – one for French and one for Spanish. Translate the Survey In your survey copies, enter translations for each of your survey questions, custom labels, and call to action buttons. Change the Default Language and Date Format We translate labels and answer text for NPS, CSAT, and CES questions based on the survey’s default language. We also change the alignment for languages that read right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. To change the default language: From your survey, select Settings . Under Localization , find Admin language . Choose the language to use as the survey default. Repeat for each survey copy. You may also need to change the date format based on your survey’s language. To change the date format: From your survey, select Settings . Under Localization , find Display date format as . Choose the date format to use as the survey default. Repeat for each survey copy. Allow Respondents to Choose a Survey Language Add a question to your default survey that lets respondents choose their default language. You’ll create a redirect for each answer option that opens the correct survey translation. To create the preferred language question: Create a multiple choice question labeled Please select your preferred language . Label each response option with the language you’ve translated your survey into. Example : If you made a copy of your survey for French, German, Spanish, and English, you’ll have each of these languages as an option on the question. Make this question required . Create Redirects for Each Survey Create a redirect exit page for each survey copy. To create a redirect: Copy the link for each of your translated surveys. In your default survey, select +Add Exit Page , then select URL redirect . Paste each survey URL into a different Redirect exit page. Now, you should have a redirect exit page for each survey language option. Add Logic to the Preferred Language Question Once you set up your redirect pages for each survey, use survey logic to send respondents to the correct survey redirect for each language option. To set up logic: Go back to the preferred language question. Add logic rules to direct respondents to the exit page that corresponds with the preferred language they chose.

Custom Forms,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/builder/custom-forms/,"Custom Forms | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Creating a Custom Form Auto-Labeling Based on Custom Forms Targeting Specifc Users Targeting URL or Path Targeting based on Country Targeting IP Addresses Saving and Activating the Form Setting Custom Forms using JavaScript Auto Labeling Example Use Case Help Survey Builder Logic Custom Forms GetFeedback Custom Forms Creating a Custom Form Auto-Labeling Based on Custom Forms Targeting Specifc Users Targeting URL or Path Targeting based on Country Targeting IP Addresses Saving and Activating the Form Setting Custom Forms using JavaScript Auto Labeling Example Use Case When you implement your GetFeedback Feedback Button on your website, you may want to show different forms to different visitors. For example, you may want to show a different feedback form to your employees or logged-in user. Use custom forms to show a different feedback form based on the URL, Country, IP, or a custom JavaScript API Command. You can also use custom forms to auto-label any incoming feedback based on the form the respondent used. Creating a Custom Form Create a custom form for an existing feedback button. If you don’t have one yet, create a feedback button before creating a custom form. To create a custom form: In the Websites section of app.usabilla.com , go to Buttons & Forms and select Setup . Find the button to add a custom form to, then select or add a custom form . Enter a name for the custom form. You can use alphanumeric characters and underscores. Design your form. Learn more After creating your form, select Next . Customize and save your form. Learn more Auto-Labeling Based on Custom Forms Set up auto-labeling to consistently apply labels to feedback across multiple brands and domains. To add labels to a custom form: In the form editor, select Advanced. You may need to scroll. In the Labels field, enter the labels to add to feedback left on this form. Select Ok. Continue editing your form. When you save and activate your form, we’ll apply the labels to any feedback sent through this form. Targeting Specifc Users In the Visitor Targeting step, you can specify which visitors will see your Custom Form. There are three targeting options available: Based on URL or Path Based on Country Based on IP -address You can use multiple targeting options. If you choose multiple, make sure the rules don’t contradict each other. Targeting URL or Path Target visitors on pages that match a specific URL or path. To target users on subpages, use a path to target that segment of the URL (example: use website.web/members to target users on pages such as website.web/members/billing). To target a URL or path: Check the box to Show this form when any of these urls/paths match. Choose when to target visitors: To target visitors when they land on a specific page, select any from the dropdown. To target visitors who aren’t on a specific page, select none from the dropdown. Enter the URL or path to target. Select + on the right to create the rule. Set the targeting conditions: Match against: Choose to target a path (a URL segment) or the full URL . Type : Choose targeting conditions: contains, starts with, ends with, is exactly , or matches regular expression . Match string : The section of the URL to target. In the example above, the custom form will be shown when the user is on: https://support.usabilla.com/hc/en-us/articles/208743525-Setting-up-Custom-Forms If, instead of ""any"" we would select ""none"", then this Custom Form would be shown on all website pages except for: https://support.usabilla.com/hc/en-us/articles/208743525-Setting-up-Custom-Forms Targeting based on Country Show a Custom Form visitors from any or none of the countries you specify. Using this option can help you gather feedback from countries where your organization doesn't operate or where you’re offering different features. We determine a visitor’s location based on their IP address. To target based on country: Check the box to Show this form when the user is from any of these countries. Choose when to target visitors: To target visitors from a specific country, select any from the dropdown. To target visitors who aren’t from a specific country, select none from the dropdown. Enter or select the countries to target. Targeting IP Addresses Show a Custom Form when any or non of the specified IPs match. You can use several notations when specifying IP addresses. If you want to show a Custom Form to colleagues it’s best to check with your network administrator to set this up properly. To target based on IP address: Check the box to Show this form when any of these IPs match. Choose when to target visitors: To target visitors from a specific IP address, select any from the dropdown. To target visitors who don’t match an IP address, select none from the dropdown. Enter the IP address to target. You can target certain values: A specific IP address (Example: 123.45.67.89) An IP address with netmask (Example: 123.45.67.89 255.255.255.0) An IP address with netmask via CIDR notation (Example: 123.45.67.89/16) A range of IP addresses (Example: 123.45.67.89-123.45.90.20) Saving and Activating the Form Once you set up your targeting options, you can finish creating your custom form by saving it. Save: Save your Custom Form without showing it to visitors. Save and Activate: Save your Custom Form and show it to visitors who match targeting conditions. To activate a custom form later, select Setup under Buttons & Forms. Then, toggle on the custom form. Setting Custom Forms using JavaScript Using the GetFeedback JavaScript API Command, you can set a specific cCustom fForm based on your own logic. You could, for example, show a custom form based on: The current time The user's login status The number of website visits The browser The OS The custom button the user clicked To set custom forms based on a JavaScript API command: Add your feedback button to your site and create your custom form. Use the setForm JavaScript API command to set your custom form. The setForm command uses the name of your custom form as the argument to decide which form to load. window.usabilla_live(""setForm"", ""Enter the exact custom form name here""); Add your own JavaScript using a Self-Invoking Function that you initialize as soon as your website and the feedback button are loaded. Alternatively, you could use the logic provided by your tag manager trigger rules with the setForm command being initialized in a separate tag. The setForm command can only be used after the feedback button has been loaded. You can add the JavaScript to your website using any method that works for you. You can either upload the JavaScript to your website or you can add it to for example using your tag manager. The example below shows three different buttons that show different custom forms based on the button the respondent selects: Auto Labeling with Custom Forms Automatically apply labels to responses sent through custom forms. You can use multiple custom forms across different brands, products, or demographics. Using automatic labeling makes it easier to manage, segment, and analyze feedback across your custom forms. Example : PuppyLove is a large national enterprise that has multiple subsidiaries. Each of the 8 subsidiaries offers the same product and acts as a competitor brand within the PuppyLove group. All 8 websites of the subsidiaries are developed by the same development team and are structured in a similar way, but they are styled differently to appeal to different demographics. PuppyLove wants to align the labels applied to all incoming feedback to make it easy for management, developers, marketers, or product owners to quickly see all feedback from a certain part of the website across all subsidiaries. Because each of the subsidiaries tries to target their own demographic, PuppyLove uses multiple feedback buttons and custom forms for each subsidiary. PuppyLove decides to label based on the customer type, product type, and interaction type. Based on their sitemap, that provided them with an instant overview of the website structure, they started with the following rules: /business: Label all B2B pages feedback with ""business"" /consumer: Label all B2C pages feedback with ""consumer"" /service: Label all customer service pages feedback with ""service"" /product: Label all product pages feedback with ""product"" Learn how to set up auto labeling Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Best Worst Scale Question,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/best-worst-scale/,"Best Worst Scale Question | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Creating Surveys Ranking & Rating Questions Best Worst Scale Question SurveyMonkey Best Worst Scale Question Paid feature : Best Worst Scale question type is only available to customers on some paid plans . The Best Worst Scale question is a closed-ended question that asks survey takers to select the best and worst option from a list of items. This lets you find out what survey takers value. People are better at judging items at extremes than rating or ranking items, so survey takers can easily let you know what’s the best and worst, most and least important, or highest or lowest priority option. This question type is used with our MaxDiff Solution , where Best Worst Scale questions are repeated in a programmatic way to understand relative importance among a longer list of items. Creating a Best Worst Question To add this question type: Go to the Design Survey section. From the Build section, choose Best Worst Scale . Enter your question and Items . You can add up to 10 items. (Optional) Set up any additional options. Click Save . Before you send your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to survey takers. Question Options Under the Options tab, you can customize the question in the following ways: Require an answer Randomize the order of items Change the question layout Enable Question Text A/B Test Limitations The Best Worst Scale question doesn’t work in conversation survey format or if you’re using a Classic theme , and it isn’t compatible with offline mode . Analyzing and Sharing Data Best Worst Scale questions are easy to analyze since they're closed-ended. Your results will be presented in a chart and in a table with the items listed down the first column, and best and worst listed across the first row. To break down your results even more, use Filter and Compare rules. Charts The Depth display option allows you to choose between the following options: Distribution : Charts the absolute number or percentage of survey takers that selected each answer choice. Weighted Average : Charts the average rating for each answer choice. The chart types available depend on the question type, and the display options you configure.

In-Page Widgets,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/web-widgets/,"In-Page Widgets | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Setting up In-Page Widgets (app.usabilla.com) Implementing an In-Page Widget Requirements & Disclaimer Embedding app.getfeedback.com Surveys Help Survey channels Website In-Page Widgets GetFeedback In-Page Widgets Setting up In-Page Widgets (app.usabilla.com) Implementing an In-Page Widget Requirements & Disclaimer Embedding app.getfeedback.com Surveys In-page widgets integrate your survey directly in the content of your website. This allows you to gather very specific element or content-related feedback. An In-Page widget looks like this: After selecting YES (or NO), your visitor will be asked to explain their answer in an open text field: You can customize these options to work best on your website. Setting up In-Page Widgets (app.usabilla.com) In-Page widgets in app.usabilla.com have 2 parts: a widget and a script . The widget is the embedded survey your visitors will get to see. The script makes sure the widget can be shown on a website. Scripts also allow you to group multiple widgets. For example, use different scripts for each of your websites or different scripts for each of your departments. If you don’t have access to In-Page, contact your Customer Success Manager. In app.usabilla.com , go to the In-Page Widgets section and select Setup. Select New widget . Name your widget. Select an existing script to install the widget on or add a new script. After this, you’ll be presented with all of the In-Page options we offer. There are quite a lot of options, so take your time to familiarize yourself with the product. You could, for example, only ask ‘Did you find this useful’ and then use the ending page or add different follow-up questions. TIP! If you have a custom theme from GetFeedback Digital for Websites (for Forms or Campaigns) these can be selected under ‘Advanced’. The In-Page widget will automatically have your colors and style. If you don’t have a custom theme, you can request one using our form . Implementing an In-Page Widget Now that you have a shiny, new In-Page widget, you’ll want to use it of course. To implement the widget, you'll have to add two pieces of code to your web page. We will start by adding the Javascript code and finish with the code for the widget itself. It's best to implement widgets using a tag manager, such as Google Tag Manager. This helps simplify implementation on a variety of frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue. To implement an in-page widget: In app.usabilla.com , find your widget, then select the install icon. Copy the code under Script snippet . Paste the code into the bottom of every page you want the widget to appear, just before the closing body tag (</body>). In app.usabilla.com, go back to the Install page for your widget. Copy the code under Widget code . Paste the code in the section of the HTML where the widget should appear. You will have to do this on every page you want the widget to appear. Make sure that the HTML container for the widget is defined before you execute the script. If you're using a Tag Management system, make sure that the firing rules are set correctly. Execute the HTML container first, then execute the script. TIP! If you’re using a CMS, make sure the Script snippet is installed on your main page template. It’s important to be consistent when implementing your scripts. For example, if you use GTM to implement your feedback button, use GTM as well for the Script snippet, too. Adding Multiple Widgets to a Page When you’re running a website that is content heavy, In-Page can provide valuable feedback that is directly related to the content on the page. Content on your website can come in a wide variety of formats like blog posts, articles, customer support pages. More specifically, we’ve found that adding In-Page to your FAQ page can help gather feedback on your content and identify improvements. Many FAQ web pages will use expandable content for hiding and showing the answers to the questions. This means that the answer to each question is hidden for the user until they expand the content. By doing so you provide your users with an overview of all questions. While you could add a single In-Page widget to your FAQ web page, you could also add multiple In-Page widgets. If you add an In-Page widget to each FAQ question you can gather feedback for each individual question. In this article, we explain step-by-step how you can automatically add multiple In-Page widgets to a single page and how you can automatically add contextual custom variables to each In-Page widget on your web page. For this step-by-step guide, it’s advised that you’re familiar with In-Page, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tag Management. Most of the code examples down below are hosted using Github Gists. If you do not see the code examples please make sure you allow for third-party content to be shown. Setup For the sake of this guide, we’ll use the Bootstrap V4 collapse element to mimic adding an In-Page widget to the expandable content of an FAQ page. The first image shows you what the default expandable looks like without an In-Page widget, the second image shows you where we would like to place the In-Page widget, and the third image shows you what the widget looks like after installation. Once you’ve figured out where you want to place your In-Page widgets, you’ll create your In-Page widget. Then, you’ll copy the Widget ID from the install page. You can reach the install page by going to the setup page followed up by clicking on the “install” icon for your widget. If you have your In-Page widget ID, copy it to a text doc. You’ll need to have it ready as we move on to coding. TIP! Add the provided JavaScript to your website using a Tag Manager. Doing this makes it easy to edit and implement the code on multiple pages. Code for Multiple Widgets To make this implementation easier, we’ve made two JavaScript functions that you can add to your website. These JavaScript functions each serve a specific purpose and must be used in order for your widget to work properly. View raw code here. The first JavaScript function, usblInPageAddCustomVarMulti(), requires 2 arguments, being the ""classname"" * and the ""widgetid"" . The ""classname"" refers to the name of the class that should be used by the function for appending the In-Page widgets. Use the class that you use for the content within the expandable content. The ""widgetid"" refers to the ID of the In-Page widget that you just created. The widget ID looks something like this “585276d3876927434b237e89” . The first function automatically creates multiple In-Page Widget codes and adds them to your web page. It does so by counting the number of HTML elements that have the specified classname. Using the number of elements, the function creates a matching number of widgets and appends them to each element with the ""classname"". View raw code here. The second JavaScript function also requires 2 parameters: ""classnamedata"" and the ""propertyname"" . The ""classnamedata"" refers to the name of the class that the function uses to retrieve the text for your custom variable. Example In this example, we’ll be adding 3 In-Page widgets within the expandable section. Then, we’ll add the text of the clickable title as a custom variable to each In-Page widget. In the code block, below there’s expandable content located in the div with the “card-block” class. We’ll use this class to hold the In-Page widget. Looking at the HTML, we can see that the text of the clickable title used for expanding the content is an with the class “faq-title”. This is the class that we’ll use for setting the custom variable to make sure you get the right context for feedback. View raw code here. Now, we’ll use JavaScript functions to add the In-Page widgets and custom variables. It’s important that you follow this sequence when running the JavaScript. The sequence is as follows: Page loads Run usblInPageAppendToClassMulti() Run usblInPageAddCustomVarMulti() Run In-Page Script snippet (not included in the script example). View raw code here. As soon as you run the script above you’ll be able to see the In-Page widgets in the HTML when you inspect the page. To illustrate, we’ll take a look at the HTML of our example. In the example, you can see that an In-Page widget has been added to each card-block div element and that each In-Page widget has a custom variable that corresponds to the adjacent title. View raw code here. After the In-Page widgets have been added you can run the Script Snippet to load the In-Page widgets. As soon as you run the script you’ll see the In-Page widget load and you can start collecting feedback. TIP! If you’re a GetFeedback for Web customer but do not have an In-Page license, please contact your Customer Success Manager. Your Customer Success Manager can provide you with a demo and training to get you started with In-Page. Not a GetFeedback customer yet? Request a demo from one of our Sales Managers. Requirements & Disclaimer For the In-Page Widget function to work properly, make sure that the elements used for appending and for the custom variable data have unique classes. Additionally, the number of elements used for appending must equal the number of custom variable elements. Avoid special characters in the custom variable names. The JavaScript mentioned in this article does not fall under the official GetFeedback Digital Product support and is therefore provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. In no event shall the author be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings. Embedding app.getfeedback.com Surveys Using app.getfeedback.com, you can distribute surveys on your website or blog by embedding your survey in a basic iframe. You'll create the URL and code for this iframe, and preview it using the Web Embed builder. To access this feature in the survey builder, navigate to Distribute > Web Embed. When building the URL to use in your iframe, we'll start with your survey’s distribution link, without any alterations. Then, as you edit how your survey looks, we'll adjust this URL accordingly. You can set up an iframe for your draft or live survey, though we only recommend using draft surveys for testing the survey implementation, not for gathering results you’d like to hang on to. It's best to use less than 10 widgets per page. Too many widgets will slow your page load speed. iFrame Branding and Navigation As you adjust the position of the progress bar, navigation, navigation width, and footer background, your survey URL in the iframe builder will update to reflect these changes. Progress Bar : You can place your progress bar at the bottom or top of the survey, or remove it altogether. Navigation : You can place the survey navigation at the bottom or top of the survey. Navigation width: If you choose an option other than ‘Auto’ for the survey Navigation, three different options for Navigation width will appear. Footer Background: A small black bar will appear behind your GetFeedback logo or personalized logo (when branding your survey ) by default. You can toggle this option to turn it on and off as needed. Exporting the iFrame Code The GetFeedback Support team isn't able to offer consulting services for coding issues because of the many nuances that may occur within your organization. This is provided as an example of where to start with your implementation, and may not cover all use cases or work in all organizational settings. After making your edits, export the iframe code by clicking Export. In the export modal, GetFeedback will prompt you to copy & close or cancel. In this example, we've set the progress bar to show at the bottom of the survey, the navigation options to show at the top of the survey, and chosen “compact” for the navigation bar width. View raw code here. To add relative height and width parameters to your iframe. After copying the iframe code, add the parameters for height and width when embedding your iframe on your website or blog. Previewing your iFrame The final section in the iframe builder is titled Preview iFrame. Editing this section of the iframe builder won’t alter your survey URL or code at all. You’ll need to make all survey placement, width, height, and background color adjustments on your own webpage. We offer this preview simply to give you a sense of what your survey might look like on your website.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. If you use our Salesforce integration, you can measure customer satisfaction (CSAT) score and report on the results in Salesforce. Learn more about the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration . CSAT helps you understand a customer’s experience with a specific interaction or transaction, such as contacting support or making a purchase. You can use CSAT with other metrics to understand the full customer experience with your brand. The CSAT question looks like the example below: Overall, how would you rate your satisfaction with our company? Very Satisfied Somewhat Satisfied Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied Somewhat Dissatisfied Very Dissatisfied This guide helps you calculate and report your CSAT scores in Salesforce. Use these formulas to calculate the CSAT score from your surveys and build reports and dashboards in Salesforce. Calculating CSAT Scores Calculate CSAT as a percentage of satisfied responses (people who selected 4 or 5). Satisfied scores are a more accurate predictor of customer retention. To calculate CSAT score: Take the number of respondents who answered 4 and 5. Divide that number by the total number of survey responses. Multiply by 100 to see the percentage of satisfied customers. The formula for CSAT scores looks like this: (Number of satisfied customers (4 and 5) / Number of survey responses) x 100 = % of satisfied customers Example : 500 people responded to a CSAT survey. 68 were Very Satisfied (score 5), and 74 were Somewhat Satisfied (score 4). Add the number of Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses to get 142. Divide 142 by the total number of responses (500). You get .284 . Multiply .284 by 100 to get 28.4%. This is your CSAT score. The equation would look like this: (142 / 500) x 100 = 28.4% Measuring CSAT with Salesforce You can track CSAT scores in Salesforce to include them in dashboards and reports. There are a few steps to complete to set up CSAT in Salesforce: Create your CSAT survey. (Optional) Create a survey object in Salesforce. Map your survey to the survey object. Send your survey to start collecting responses. Create a CSAT report in Salesforce with a summary formula. Create a CSAT Survey Create a survey with a 5-point scale question. There are 2 ways to build this question: Use a Matrix/Rating Scale question type, and select the checkbox to Make this a single-row rating scale . This will add weights to each answer option. Use a Multiple Choice question type and enable scoring. Your question should include the following answer choices: Very Satisfied (score = 5) Somewhat Satisfied (score = 4) Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied (score = 3) Somewhat Dissatisfied (score = 2) Very Dissatisfied (score = 1) You can also use a CSAT survey template to quickly build a CSAT survey. (optional) Create a Survey Object in Salesforce Create a custom object to hold CSAT responses from your survey. You’ll map survey responses to this object using the Salesforce integration. If you already have a survey object, make sure you have fields to hold your CSAT score (ex: 5) and the label (ex: Very Satisfied). When creating your survey object: Include a field for every survey question/answer you want to map to Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to understand which field types you need to include on your object. Include a field for each custom variable in your survey. Set Up Mappings In the SurveyMonkey Salesforce integration, map your survey to your survey object in Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to understand which field types you can map responses to. Send Your Survey When you finish creating mappings, send your survey using the methods available in the Salesforce integration. You can either: Create a weblink to send any way you want. Send an email from SurveyMonkey using a Salesforce outbound message. When someone takes your survey, their responses will be mapped to Salesforce. You can then create reports and dashboards to track CSAT in Salesforce. Create Salesforce Reports and Group Responses In SurveyMonkey, you can always view your responses in the Analyze Results section of your survey. Review question summaries, track data trends over time, or drill into individual responses . However, if you create reports in Salesforce, you can group customers by CSAT score. You can use this data to quickly find unsatisfied customers. SurveyMonkey can’t consult on coding issues in your Salesforce environment. Reach out to your Salesforce administrator for help implementing these formulas. These examples help you get started with our Salesforce integration, and you may need to make changes for your organization. To report on CSAT scores in Salesforce: Create a custom report type in Salesforce for your survey object. You’ll use this report to calculate your CSAT score. Create a new Salesforce summary report using your new report type. You can choose to summarize CSAT by Survey Name, or filter the report to only show specific Surveys. Write a summary formula in your report to calculate your score. The formula below is an example of a CSAT calculation formula. Make sure to update the formula with the correct object name and field names based on how it’s been set up in your environment. We recommend selecting Grand Total Only when applying the formula. Your survey respondents will be grouped by score on the report.

Instead, use the following question types on new surveys: Name , Email address , Phone , Address . Using the Contact Information question type, you can collect respondent demographic information through a single question. Video Overview Using a Contact Information Question It isn't possible to add the Contact information question to new surveys. However, this question remains available on existing surveys. By default, the following fields are available, but you can customize the field labels to collect different pieces of information you might need: Name Company Address Address 2 City/Town State/Province ZIP/Postal Code Country Email Phone You can also choose to hide some of the available fields by deselecting the Visible checkbox to the right of each field under the Edit tab. Displaying State as a Dropdown of U.S. States By default, the State/Province field will display as an open-ended text field. However, if you know that all of your respondents live in the United States, you can choose to display the State field as Dropdown of U.S. States. This will make it easier for respondents to select the appropriate answer, and eliminate the chance of typos. Displaying Countries as a Dropdown There is no way to display the Country field as a dropdown menu, but you can add a Dropdown question type right after the Contact Information question. You can copy and paste a list of countries into a Dropdown question, or use a pre-written question from the Question Bank . Additional Options Under the Options tab, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Require an answer for all fields, or only a subset Change the question size & layout Enable question text A/B test Learn more: Editing Questions Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. You can't validate the Contact Information question type to require respondents to answer in a specific format, length, or range. Respondents will not encounter validation error messages, but they may see an error message if they don't answer all of the required fields that you define under the Options tab. Analyzing Results When you view your results in the Analyze Results section, you can use the Tagging Responses and Word Cloud features to identify recurring words or tag responses for each textbox. Charts are not generated for this open-ended question type.

How to Set a Deadline on a Stage,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/stage-deadline/,"How to Set a Deadline on a Stage | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Apply a Stage Deadline How Deadlines Work Deadlines on Reviewer Tasks Help Build Workflow and Stages How to Set a Deadline on a Stage Apply How to Set a Deadline on a Stage How to Apply a Stage Deadline How Deadlines Work Deadlines on Reviewer Tasks It is common for Administrators to require the tasks within their stages to be completed by a specific date. For example, you may require applicants to submit all application materials by a deadline, or your reviewers to complete all of their reviews. Our Deadlines feature will allow you to apply these limits to your Stages on your site. If you wish to apply a deadline to a specific applicant task you can refer to How to Set a Deadline on an Applicant Task . How to Apply a Stage Deadline Stage deadlines prevent applicants, recommenders or reviewers from accessing a stage and all the tasks in that stage after the deadline has passed. You can apply a deadline to a stage with the following steps: Go to your Workflow Click on the Name of the stage to access the stage configurations. Click on Settings Click on the Close Date/ Deadline field to access the Date Calendar Select a deadline date you wish to apply to the stage. Add a Time for when the deadline will be closed. The time zone that is set will be based on your sites time zone. However, to the end user, the time will be converted to display in the user's time zone. Optional: Enter a grace period (in hours) . Grace periods allow users to access or edit a stage after the deadline has passed. This grace period will not be displayed to the users. This value can only be a whole number and the grace period cannot be placed with a decimal, such as 1.5. You can now click Save to confirm your changes. NOTE: The stage deadline will be automatically applied to all tasks within the stage. However, if an individual task has its own task deadline, the task deadline will override the stage deadline, provided that the deadline on the task is before the stage deadline. How Deadlines Work Deadlines require users to complete stages by certain dates so your process can stay on schedule. Once a deadline for a stage passes, users can no longer access or edit the tasks within the stage. Deadlines on Reviewer Tasks Since Reviewer stages can only contain one reviewer task per stage, if you wish to apply a deadline to the reviewer task you can do so by applying the deadline to the Reviewer Stage instead.

There are a few additional settings you can use: Custom screening questions: Make your target audience even more specific by adding up to 3 screener questions. Schedule for later: Schedule your survey’s launch up to a month in advance. Exclusions: Prevent respondents who have taken other surveys you’ve created in the past 100 days from participating. Not sure where to start? Learn how to buy responses with SurveyMonkey Audience . Custom Screening Questions Make your target audience even more specific by adding up to 3 screener questions. This will require even more responses to reach your goal. For example, you want to target people with small dogs . You choose “owns a dog” in your targeting criteria when setting up your SurveyMonkey Audience project. In your survey design, you can include the following screening question: How large is your dog? Small Medium Large Respondents that choose “small” should be allowed to continue the survey, while respondents who choose “medium” or “large” should be disqualified, since they don’t meet the criteria for your survey. To add custom screening questions: Go to the Optional settings section. Toggle on the Custom screening questions option. Make sure you’ve added a question to the beginning of your survey. We recommend Multiple Choice or Checkboxes. Choose the percentage of people you expect to qualify for your survey based on your screening questions. This is called the Qualification Rate. Schedule for Later Select a date and time to collect responses for your chosen audience. This can help you target respondents in a different time zone or send your survey after a specific event occurs. You can choose a date and time up to a month in the future. On the date you select, we’ll send your survey to your target audience. The scheduled time is based on the time zone set in your SurveyMonkey account. To schedule your survey’s launch: Go to the Optional settings section. Toggle on the Schedule for later option. Choose the date and time you want to send your survey. Exclusions Exclusions help you collect new responses from different panelists if you’re relaunching your survey. Here are two ways to exclude previous panelists from taking your survey. Exclusions for the Same Survey When you relaunch a survey via SurveyMonkey Audience, we automatically exclude any panelists who took this survey in the past. Simply create a new Audience collector for the same survey to apply the exclusions. Here’s how it works. Let's say you send survey A for the first time. If you send survey A again one month later, we automatically exclude panelists who previously took survey A . This way, you get a new set of responses. Exclusions for a Different Survey Exclude duplicate panelists from taking different surveys that you’ve previously sent. For example, you create survey B and need a new set of panelists. Before sending survey B , use the Exclusions option on the Audience calculator page and select survey A from the dropdown menu. Any panelists who took survey A will not be sent survey B . To exclude respondents from surveys you've sent via SurveyMonkey Audience: Toggle on the Exclusions option. Select the surveys that you need excluded. TIP! If your survey was sent more than 100 days ago, it won't be displayed in the exclusions dropdown menu. Contact us to apply survey exclusions on your behalf, and then provide us the following information: - Title of the survey you need to send. - Targeting criteria for the new survey. - Title of the surveys you sent before—we’ll prevent panelists who took this survey from taking your new survey.

With test variant IDs, you can filter and segment feedback items and campaign results to compare feedback from different test variants and see which one your users' prefer. Assign GetFeedback Digital campaigns to a specific test variant Pushing test variant IDs to GetFeedback Digital also lets you show a survey to users in a specific test variant. Learn more about setting up campaign targeting. Push user feedback from GetFeedback Digital to AB Tasty When a user has left feedback or responded to a campaign, you can push those results to AB Tasty. In AB Tasty, you'll then be able to view the feedback data from GetFeedback with the AB Tasty reporting suite. This lets you follow up on feedback in real-time or in later sessions. For example, if a visitor files a bug report through GetFeedback, you’ll be able to inform the user about the fix during their next session. Pushing user feedback to AB Tasty works the same way as adding GetFeedback data to your data layer. Using setEventCallbacks, you can trigger a data push to AB Tasty every time a user leaves feedback while AB Tasty is active on the webpage. Send your GetFeedback feedback and campaign data to AB Tasty using this snippet: _abtasty.push([""cv"",""key"", ""value""]); Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

The Salesforce integration in GetFeedback helps you create visually engaging and mobile-ready surveys, send surveys automatically, and map responses back to Salesforce. For example, you can use the Salesforce integration to send surveys after: Closing a case in Salesforce Releasing a new feature Selling a product or service Hosting a company event You can also map survey responses back to Salesforce cases, accounts, and many other objects. Connecting GetFeedback to Salesforce Start using your GetFeedback for Salesforce integration by connecting Salesforce to your GetFeedback account. To connect GetFeedback to Salesforce: From the left side menu, select Integrations > Salesforce . Select Add Connection . You may need to scroll to the bottom of the connection list. If you don’t see the Add Connection button, your GetFeedback administrator may need to give you permission to add connections. Enter a Connection Name . Select the Organization Type , either Sandbox or Production. The organization type doesn’t affect the way your connection works in GetFeedback. Select Add . A Salesforce login page displays. Enter your Salesforce username and password, then select Login . Review the access request, then select Allow to complete your connection. Connecting Multiple Salesforce Environments You can connect GetFeedback to multiple Salesforce environments, such as your sandbox and production environments, depending on how many Salesforce connections are included with your GetFeedback plan. You'll always be able to see how many Salesforce connections you have remaining. If you need more connections, contact our Sales team . (Admins) Managing Your Salesforce Connections Team administrators can manage how each team member connects to Salesforce by: Giving individual team members access to certain Salesforce connections Enabling or disabling mappings permissions for each team member Team members can connect their surveys to any Salesforce connections they have access to. To manage your team's Salesforce connections and permissions: Log in to GetFeedback using your administrator account. From the left side menu, select Integrations > Salesforce . Allowing Your Team to Add Salesforce Connections To allow a team member to add Salesforce connections: Find the team member who should be able to add connections.

Connecting a Survey to Salesforce After getting access to a Salesforce connection, you can connect your individual survey to Salesforce. To connect your survey to Salesforce: From your survey, select Mappings . To use our prebuilt Managed Mappings package, select Salesforce Managed Mappings . Learn how to set up managed mappings To map to custom objects, select Salesforce Custom Mappings. Learn how to set up custom mappings In Draft mode, select the Salesforce connection to send Draft or Live survey results to. Set up your mappings. Learn how to set up managed mappings or custom mappings Changing a Survey's Salesforce Connection After connecting your survey to Salesforce, you can switch between connections at any time. For example, you can switch between a Sandbox and Production instance to test your mappings before publishing your survey. Test your mappings when switching connections to make sure your responses map correctly. If you test your survey with a Sandbox connection and switch to a Production environment, your test responses won’t be deleted. If you want to keep test responses separate, you can create a copy of your survey instead of switching the connection on your existing survey. To switch a survey's Salesforce connection: From your survey, select Mappings . Select either Salesforce Managed Mappings or Salesforce Custom Mappings . From the dropdowns at the top, select a different connection for your Draft or Live survey. You’ll get a message asking you to make sure your mappings still work with your new connection. To continue switching the connection, select Okay at the message. Deleting a Salesforce Connection You can delete a connection and still keep the mappings built in your surveys using that connection. If you reconnect your survey to a Salesforce environment, your mappings will work again. To delete a Salesforce connection: If you want to keep your mappings, create a new Salesforce connection. Change the connection for any surveys using the connection you want to delete. Select Integrations > Salesforce from the left side menu. Select the pencil button on the connection you want to delete. Select Delete connection . At the warning message, select Disconnect . The Salesforce connection is permanently deleted. Any surveys still using this connection will stop sending results to Salesforce. Troubleshooting Salesforce Integration There are a few common issues that can occur when getting your GetFeedback account set up with Salesforce. Connection Issues If you can’t connect to Salesforce, you might see the error Unable to Add Salesforce Connection and Error: this app is blocked by admin . If you get this error, contact your Salesforce administrator to make some changes to your security policy. You'll need to make changes to your Connected Apps Oauth settings in Salesforce to resolve the issue. Merge Field Issues There are a few common errors when mapping a survey to Salesforce. Here's a list of common merge field errors and how to resolve them. Issue Resolution Survey ownership The survey owner needs to create and edit Salesforce mappings. If you can't create mappings, make sure you're the owner of the survey. If not, ask the owner to transfer the survey to you. Incorrect Salesforce IDs Make sure your merge fields use the right ID prefix when pulling in data. Here is a guide for ID prefixes: 001 - Account ID 003 - Contact ID 006 - Opportunity ID 015 - Document ID 500 - Case ID 00O - Reports ID 00Q - Lead ID 701 - Campaign ID If the IDs don’t match the unique ID you wish to pull in, change the merge field to {!Contact.ID}, {!Account.ID}, {!Opportunity.ID}etc. to match the unique record ID. Mapping to incompatible Salesforce fields Make sure you’re mapping questions to the correct Salesforce field types. Some questions can only be mapped to certain field types. Learn more about compatible fields in Salesforce Broken survey link A broken link won’t pull in merge fields correctly, so you'll only see part of your information or merge fields coming in your Results tab. To fix broken links, encode the merge fields where you think there might be spaces appearing (such as a full name, address, or zip code merge field). URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. To use URL encoding, add a short piece of code to each merge field. For example, change Address={!Contact.MailingStreet} to Address={!URLENCODE(Contact.MailingStreet)} If encoding doesn’t fix the broken link, or the link is still cut off, try hyperlinking the survey link behind text (such as “Click here to take the survey!”) in your Salesforce email template. Salesforce IDs and lookup relationships Make sure to add any IDs as merge fields so we can tie your response back to the lookup relationship or a case, contact, or account. When you create a custom object, you’ll want to relate it to another Salesforce object, such as Contacts, Accounts, or Cases using lookup relationships . For example, if you have a custom object that has a lookup relationship to Contacts, you’ll want to include the merge field {!Contact.ID} in your survey link. To place your survey responses into a custom object associated with Contacts, create a Lookup field to contact in your new custom object. For example, the URL might look like this if contact is the lookup - https://www.getfeedback.com/r/lKnRo1e3?ContactId={!Contact.ID} Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Single Sign-on (SSO),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/account/single-sign-on/,"Single Sign-on (SSO) | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Benefits of SSO How SSO Works in GetFeedback Setting Up an SSO Connection with GetFeedback Help Account Management Team management Single Sign-on (SSO) GetFeedback Single Sign-on (SSO) Benefits of SSO How SSO Works in GetFeedback Setting Up an SSO Connection with GetFeedback Single Sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows you to securely authenticate multiple applications with one set of credentials. In this case, you’ll be able to log in to GetFeedback using your organization's internal login system. Benefits of SSO Users only need to sign in one time to access multiple applications and do not have to manage different credentials for each. You won’t need to invite new employees to use GetFeedback. A new account will automatically be created for any user granted access to GetFeedback in the organization's identity provider. Employees will automatically lose access once they are removed from the organization's identity provider. Your company can enforce the same level of security requirements across multiple applications (e.g. password requirements and expiration dates, 2-factor authentication, etc). How SSO Works in GetFeedback Our GetFeedback SSO connection supports Identity Providers with SAML configurations (SAML 1.1 or SAML 2.0). Setup is completed by our team after receiving your SSO information. GetFeedback doesn't have SCIM support and doesn't support provisioning of roles and groups. Once the SAML connection is set up, all account team members are required to log in via SSO. Users won't be able to log in with their email/password. New users won’t be invited through the Team Settings page. Instead, new accounts are set up the first time they log in. New users are assigned read-only access. However, permissions and roles can be changed by admins from the Team Settings page. Users removed from the company’s identity provider will lose access to GetFeedback once they log out. GetFeedback Digital (app.usabilla.com) has JIT provisioning for SSO users. If someone logs in using SSO and doesn't exist in Digital, the user will be created automatically. Setting Up an SSO Connection with GetFeedback If you're interested in setting up an SSO connection with GetFeedback, please contact your CSM with the following information: Your identity provider e.g. Okta, Azure AD , OneLogin , etc. Signing certificate (including algorithm) This is your identity provider's SAMLp server public key, encoded in PEM or CER format. Sign-in endpoint This is the URL from your identity provider where users sign in. Email domains you'd like to enable SSO for Required so that your team is identified as SSO users and directed to the SSO sign-in page. SAML assertion example (or the key for the field that contains the user’s email) This is the field in your identity provider's SAML implementation that contains the user's email address.

How to Return the First Input Value (COALESCE),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/coalesce-value/,"How to Return the First Input Value (COALESCE) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the COALESCE Function? Proper Formatting for COALESCE Expressions Limitations of the COALESCE Function Help Advanced Features How to Return the First Input Value (COALESCE) Apply How to Return the First Input Value (COALESCE) What is the COALESCE Function? Proper Formatting for COALESCE Expressions Limitations of the COALESCE Function Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. This article will explain the process of using the COALESCE function to return the first input value in a list. What is the COALESCE Function? The COALESCE function accepts a list of floating or integer values and displays the first value in the list of variables. This can either be used for a single row or column within a grid question, the table as a whole or a list of variables within the form. Proper Formatting for COALESCE Expressions The setup and formatting of the COALESCE expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the COALESCE expression should be set up as follows: {{ COALESCE(variable1,variable2) }} Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of COALESCE and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive Always close the COALESCE operation with brackets ( ) Can contain a (,) to separate values. Cannot contain any operators such (+),(-),(*), etc. COALESCE of Select Cells {{ COALESCE(q1[0],q1[2],[q1[3]) }} Based on Grid Indexing , this will pull the first value from the 1st, 3rd, and 4th cells. Therefore if the 1st cell does not contain a response the value will be pulled from the 3rd cell. COALESCE of a Column {{ COALESCE(q1[:0]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will return the value in the first cell of column 1 to contain a response. COALESCE of a Row {{ COALESCE(q2[1:]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will return the value in the first cell of row 2 to contain a response. COALESCE of a Range {{ COALESCE(q1[0:4]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will pull the the value from the first cell in the list. COALESCE of Reviewer Scores {{ COALESCE(q1.score,q2.score,q3.score) }} Pull the value of the first reviewer question score in the form. If the first question is skipped, the second will be pulled. Limitations of the COALESCE Function The COALESCE function would not be able to perform any operations using an expression such as addition (+) nor would it be possible to have other functions within a COALESCE expression as the expression does not allow for calculations to occur. If you are planning on using fields that are created through expression piping, you will first need to perform the first function on one page and then pipe those fields into the next page using the COALESCE function.

GetFeedback Managed Mapping for Salesforce offers a simple way to push survey responses into your Salesforce organization. Our Managed Mapping package creates three new objects in your Salesforce environment and maps survey responses to them. Managed Mappings can’t create new records or push response data to Standard or Custom objects. If you want to send data to Standard or Custom objects, use GetFeedback Custom Mapping instead. Video Installing Managed Mappings To use Managed Mappings, you need to install a small package in your Salesforce organization. To install the Managed Mapping package: Connect your Salesforce organization to GetFeedback . From your survey, go to Mappings > Salesforce Managed Mappings . Make sure you’re in Draft mode. Select the Salesforce organization to push Draft or Live responses to. Select Install Managed Package . Follow the instructions on the screen to install the package. When installation is complete, go back to GetFeedback. Turn on the toggle to Sync to Salesforce using Managed Mappings . Objects in the Managed Mapping Package After installing the managed package, we add three objects to your Salesforce organization: Survey , Response , and Answer . Object Description Survey Each individual survey you design in GetFeedback and map to Salesforce creates Salesforce by a unique Survey record. The first response you push to Salesforce for the survey creates the Survey record. The Survey record contains basic information, like the survey name. Response Each time a respondent submits a survey response, we create a new record on the Response object. Each Response record contains information about the response submission (not the answers within the response), including the date and time the response was submitted and a link to view the response in GetFeedback. Each Response record has a lookup reference to its parent Survey record. If you added merge fields to your survey, you can associate your Response record with those records in Salesforce using lookup relationships . Answer For every survey question submitted, we create a new record on the Answer object. Each Answer record contains full details of the survey question and the respondent’s answer. Each Answer record has a lookup reference to its parent Response record and to the appropriate Survey record. Managed Mapping Data Structure Each answer value is stored in one or more fields on the Answer object. The type of field may vary depending on the GetFeedback question type. The Display Value formula field is used to display the answer value for viewing purposes, regardless of data type. Customizing Page Layouts in Salesforce To better view a contact’s survey responses in Salesforce, your admin can add the Response and Answer objects to the Contact Page Layout. After changing the page layout, you can view someone’s survey responses on their Contact record. To customize the Contact Page Layout in Salesforce: In Salesforce Setup , go to Object Manager . Go to the Contact object, then select Page Layouts . Select Contact Layout . In the Contact Layout box, select Related Lists . Drag the Answers and Responses labels to the area below, then save your page layout. Creating Reports and Dashboards in Salesforce Managed Mappings push data to Salesforce so you can build Salesforce Reports and Dashboards. Talk to your Salesforce representative to learn how to implement reporting in your Salesforce organization. Each answer value is stored in one or more fields on the Answer record. Build your reports based on the appropriate fields on the Answer object. For example, if you’re reporting on numeric data, you’ll want to use the Number field. You can also filter Salesforce reports to only include certain questions. Enabling Reporting To create reports, you need to enable reporting on your Survey, Response, and Answer objects. To enable reporting for your objects in Salesforce: In Salesforce, g o to the object. Select Edit . Check the box to Allow Reports , then Save . Creating Reports Once you've enabled reporting on all three objects, you can create your report in Salesforce. Select the Surveys with Responses with Answers report type. You can adjust the date range and filter your report by Survey, Responses, and Answers. For example, you can report on NPS by filtering the Number field based on QuestionType = NetPromoter , or on QuestionTitle = How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?

Checkbox Question,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/checkbox-question/,"Checkbox Question | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Add a Checkbox Question Choice Settings Display Settings Options Settings Help Build Form Question Types Checkbox Question Apply Checkbox Question How to Add a Checkbox Question Choice Settings Display Settings Options Settings The checkbox question type lets your users select more than one answer from a list of choices you provide. If you wish to ensure your users only select one of your available choices we would recommend using a Multiple Choice question instead. How to Add a Checkbox Question Within your form, click on the Questions tab. Under Basic Questions, double-click or click and drag the Checkbox question to add it to your form. Optional: Add an Identifier to your question Enter the Question Title Optional: Add a Description Add your Choices. Set the Choice Settings Optional: If you have an added text response, set the +Additional Options of each Variable, in order to set the Validation and Initial Value of the Variable. Set the +Display settings Set the +Options settings i. Decide if the Variable will be Required or Optional NOTE: You can add the Choices individually by clicking Add or by clicking the Bulk button. You can add the variables in a list within the Bulk Editor . You can also Add Other Choice which will automatically add a choice with an additional text response field to collect more information. Choice Settings Choice Setting Description Exclusive Choice When a question choice has this option enabled, it is the only option that the user can select. Use this as a “none of the above"" option. Meaning once the user selects this answer choice, their previous question choices for this question will be replaced with just this one. Select All When the select all option is enabled, the user only has to click this one answer to select all the possible answers for that question. Use this as an ""all of the above"" option. Add Text Response Adds a text response field next to the question choice. When checked, you also have the option of adding validation and marking the text response as mandatory when that choice is selected. Static Choice This option can be used with question randomization logic. When this logic is applied, a question choice with static choice enabled will remain in the same location for every user. TIP! If you have an ""Other"" choice, and wish to Randomize, or Alphabetize your choices, this will ensure that Other is always at the bottom of the list. Score Scoring in a Checkbox field is slightly different then other Closed Ended Questions. You can add a score to the choice if you wish to calculate a score internally within the form using Advanced Expression Piping . For review forms, Scores given on Checkbox questions will NOT be included in the overall score of the form. Display Settings Display Setting Description Appearance Changes the layout and appearance of the question’s answer choices. - Default: The choices will be displayed Vertically within your form - Horizontal: The choices will be displayed Horizontally within the form - Combo box: The choices will be displayed in a box format, similar to a Drill Down question Columns This will determine how many columns your list of choices are displayed in. By default the choices will be displayed in one column. This can be useful if you have a long list of choices. Display side-by-side Display this question side by side with another question. This will need to be enabled on the other question as well. Append to previous question This question type appends to the question before it to make it appear that they are connected within the form. NOTE: Any Branching Logic , such as to hide or show the previous question, will also apply to this question. However, the requirement settings won't be. If it is meant to be hidden it will need to be included in the branching logic as well. Width You can adjust the width based on a percentage of the size of the page. By default, the value is 100% to make it to the fit the page size. Options Settings Options Description Optional Enabling this will make the question Optional. When a user enters the form, if the question is Optional they will be able to proceed and complete the form without providing a response to this question. Randomize Choices Selecting this option randomizes the choices within the Multiple Choice upon each form refresh. Alphabetize choices Choices within your Checkbox will appear in alphabetical order (A-Z). TIP! Use this if you are going to be adding choices to your form after already collecting data. This will allow you to maintain your alphabetical order without jeopardizing your data. Refer to How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form for more information. Restrict number of selected choices Restrict the number of choices a user can select. If you wish for an exact value that the user has to select, for example, they have to select 3, you can set both the minimum and maximum value to be the same. Show number of options checked Shows the number of checkboxes the user has checked. This can be useful when there are many checkbox answer choices and a limit on how many the user can select.

Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/calculating-respondents/,"Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Solutions SurveyMonkey Audience Panel Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need SurveyMonkey Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need The number of respondents you need depends on your survey goals and how confident you want to be in your results. The more confident you want to be, the less of a margin of error you should accept. To calculate the number of respondents you need (known as your sample size), use our sample size calculator . TIP! If you need a guaranteed number of respondents, buy survey responses from SurveyMonkey Audience. You specify the number of responses you need and we'll use your targeting criteria to find you respondents. Definitions To calculate your sample size, you'll need to know the following information: Expand | Collapse Population Size Your population size is the size of the entire population you wish to represent. Population : The entire group you're interested in making conclusions about. Sample : The group you're surveying. Think about the potential size of your target population. For example, if you're sending a survey to male iPhone users in California, you may need to do some research to determine how many total men fit that criteria. Margin of Error Margin of error tells you how much error surrounds a measure. It's a percentage that describes how much the opinions and behavior of the sample you survey is likely to deviate from the total population. To calculate your margin of error, use our margin of error calculator . The smaller the margin of error is, the closer you are to having the exact answer at a given confidence level. In general, the larger your sample size, the lower the margin of error. The closer your sample is in size to your population, the more representative your results are likely to be. And that’s why you’ll notice that the recommended sample size in the table below gets smaller as your tolerance for error gets larger. For example, let's say we asked 400 people if they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Barack Obama and 55% say favorable. Using a 95% confidence level and ±5% margin of error, if we repeated this survey 100 times under the same conditions, 95 out of 100 times, the response would be somewhere between 50% and 60%. Confidence Level A confidence level tells you how reliable a measure is. Common standards used by researchers are 90%, 95%, and 99%. A 95% confidence level means if the same survey were to be repeated 100 times under the same conditions, 95 times out of 100 the measure would lie somewhere within the margin of error. When calculating your sample size, you'll use the z-score for your confidence level. The z-score is the number of standard deviations a given proportion is away from the mean. Confidence Level z-score 90% 1.65 95% 1.96 99% 2.58 Percentage Value Sample size requirements vary based on the percentage of your sample that picks a particular answer. For example, if in a previous survey you found that 75% of your customers said yes they are satisfied with your product and you are looking to conduct that survey again, you can use p = 0.75 to calculate your needed sample size. If you're running a survey for the first time, and since most surveys have more than one question (and therefore more than one percentage value to evaluate), we recommend using p = 0.5 to calculate your optimum sample size. This produces a sample size estimate that is neither too conservative nor too loose. Calculating Sample Size Calculate the number of respondents you need in seconds using our sample size calculator . If you’d like to do the sample size calculation by hand, use the following formula: Statistic Description N Population Size e Margin of Error (as a decimal) z Confidence Level (as a z-score) p Percentage Value (as a decimal) Suggested Sample Sizes Below is a table with suggested population sizes by margin of error at a 95% confidence level. We used the above formula to calculate the suggested sample sizes. In some cases, we rounded the sample sizes up to the nearest 5 or 10. For a more exact calculation, use our sample size calculator . Population Size Sample Size per Margin of Error Sample Size per Margin of Error Sample Size per Margin of Error ±3% ±5% ±10% 500 345 220 80 1,000 525 285 90 3,000 810 350 100 5,000 910 370 100 10,000 1,000 385 100 100,000+ 1,100 400 100 Example Sample Size You're sending a survey with a Yes or No question asking if parents of children at your school are in favor of an extended school day. The total number of parents (your population size) is 10,000 and you're comfortable with a ±10% margin of error. Using the table above, you can see you'll need at least 100 people to take your survey. 70% of the 100 parents surveyed answered that they are in favor of an extended school day. This means you can assume that if all 10,000 parents answered the survey, between 60% to 80% of people would be in favor of an extended school day. How many people should I ask to take my survey? Your response rate may affect the number of people you send your survey to. The higher the response rate, the fewer people you need to ask to take your survey. For example, if you need 100 respondents and you expect 25% of the people invited to take your survey will actually respond, then you need to invite 400 people to take your survey. To calculate the number of people you need to invite to take your survey based on your expected response rate, use the following equation: Respondents needed Take the number of people you need to answer your survey ÷ Response rate Divide by the expected response rate (use 25 for 25%, if you use .25 skip step 3) x 100 Then multiply by 100 (to account for the using a percentage versus a decimal in step 2) Related Articles SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings Feature Importance (MaxDiff) Using SurveyMonkey for Market Research English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Event Targeting for App Campaigns,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/app-custom-events/,"Event Targeting for App Campaigns | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Choosing Custom or Standard Events Examples of Custom Events Planning Custom Events Example: Planning an Event Using an Event in a Campaign Help Survey channels Mobile App Event Targeting for App Campaigns GetFeedback Event Targeting for App Campaigns Choosing Custom or Standard Events Examples of Custom Events Planning Custom Events Example: Planning an Event Using an Event in a Campaign When creating an app campaign , such as a popup survey, you’ll target specific app visitors by implementing events. When an event is triggered, GetFeedback shows the survey to your app visitor. Event targeting lets you ask for targeted feedback at specific points in the customer journey. An event signifies that an action occurred in your app. This action can be anything, from making a purchase to opening or closing the app menu. The event can be initiated by the user (ex: clicking a button) or by the app (ex: the user's flight has just arrived). You can use two types of events for app campaigns: Standard events : Common events, such as ""App closed early"" or ""App not updated."" These events are pre-implemented in our SDK and don't require additional engineering work. Learn more Custom events : Target respondents after a specific action happens in your app. For example, you can show your survey after someone makes a purchase. You'll need help from your app development team to use a custom event. You can create custom events based on the actions or moments you want to target in your app. It's best to speak to your technical team to learn which events can help you to target the right users. Choosing Custom or Standard Events Custom events are the most flexible targeting option for your campaigns. Your team defines custom events so you can target any event or action in the app. Custom events can have a positive effect on your campaign's conversion rate. However, your development team will need to program your app to use custom events. For more common use cases, such as showing the campaign after someone closes the app early, consider using our pre-implemented standard events instead. Standard events are already programmed in the GetFeedback SDK and don’t require additional work from your development team. Examples of Custom Events Custom events are highly customizable and closely follow the behavior of your users in your app. Some examples of possible events are: Learning more about your users When the user opens the app When the user performs a number of searches in your app When your user leave a certain flow (ex: if they don't complete the checkout or booking flow) When clicking a button Measure specific metrics After opening the app a number of times After completing an offline event, such as taking a flight or receiving an order After completing an action in the app After using the search functionality in your app Planning Custom Events To use custom events, your app’s development team will need to implement the event. For more common use cases, such as showing the campaign after someone closes the app early, consider using our pre-implemented standard events instead. To help you define the custom events to use your campaigns, consider the following 4 questions. These questions can help you create events and campaigns that are relevant to you and guide your developers when they create events. What are you trying to achieve with your Campaign? Before thinking of any event, consider the goal you have in mind for your campaign. Do you want to set up a campaign to measure the KPIs that are set, or do you want to notify users about a new feature in your app? By having a clear goal, you'll also be able to think about what type of campaign to use and what type of question elements to use. For example, is a shorter or longer survey best for your campaign? Where should the Campaign be displayed? Once you have your goal and know what you want to ask in your Campaign, consider where the campaign should be triggered. Consider mapping the customer journeys in your app. By having a clear overview of the different routes users can take to achieve their goal, you'll know exactly when to show your campaign. What are the events for me? Once you have a clear picture of what you would like to achieve with your Campaigns and what the best place is to display your Campaign, the next step is combining these two things with the Events you would like to use. Consider these questions to help you define the events: What action should trigger the Event? Is it something the user does or is it something that the app does? What name describes the Event best? Consider creating an Event Library with the result of each of the previous steps. This document can be the reference point for everyone in your team that will be creating campaigns or events. A completed Event Library contains at least 3 columns with the following information: What is the goal of the Campaign Where in the app should the campaign be displayed? Which users should be targeted? What event should trigger the campaign, and when is it triggered? The image below shows an example of a completed event library: Connecting with Development In most cases the app developers will create the custom events for your app. It's best to meet with your developers and share the outcome of the previous three steps by sharing the Event Library. Since there is a chance your app is already using events from a different SDK certain events may already be defined. Your meeting with developers can also help you estimate how long it will take to implement the custom events and when you start using them. Example: Planning an Event To clarify each of these steps, let's set up a test scenario where we can apply each of these steps. Scenario: our app has a new feature that lets users display locations of nearby candy stores. We want to get feedback from people using it to see if and how we can improve this functionality. Campaign goal: the campaign goal is to ask people using the new feature how they would rate the feature on a scale of 1 to 5. When they respond to this question with a rating from 1 to 3, we want to show a comment field where respondents can explain how the feature could be improved. Since we want to know how we can improve this feature, we'll target users who have used the feature more than 5 times. Targeting options: We want to show the campaign after someone has used the feature successfully. In this example, the app would trigger the new functionality and either let the user find or manually enter their location. Once the app has their location, it will display all of the stores sorted from near to far. Once this list is shown, the campaign should trigger. Event name: Based on the action that triggers the event, we'll use the name ""LocationShown."" Using an Event in a Campaign After your developers have implemented the event, go to GetFeedback for Apps and create your campaign . In the User Targeting section, you can enter the event and set additional targeting conditions, such as device language. You can show a campaign to your users as soon as an event is fired, or only after an event has been fired a number of times. Learn more about creating app campaigns Make sure that the targeted event is identical to the event that your developer specified in your app. Custom event names are case sensitive . After specifying the event in your campaign targeting, activate and test your campaign. As soon as the GetFeedback Digital SDK has been implemented in your app and your events have been added, you can activate and deactivate new campaigns without making any code changes. Your campaign will be live as soon as it's activated.

Response Quality,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/response-quality/,"Response Quality | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Using Response Quality Flag Types Analyzing Response Quality Response Quality When Buying Responses Help Analyzing Results Understanding Your Results Response Quality SurveyMonkey Response Quality Using Response Quality Flag Types Analyzing Response Quality Response Quality When Buying Responses PAID FEATURE: Response Quality is available to customers on some paid plans in the US Data Center . Response Quality uses machine learning to scan your survey results and flag poor-quality responses. For example, if a survey-taker fills a comment box with gibberish, or answers option A on every question, we’ll flag the response so you can focus on high-quality survey data. Requirements To view Response Quality status, the survey needs to be in English, have more than 50 responses, and the response status must be complete . Survey responses collected before March 2nd, 2020 can’t be reviewed for quality. Unsupported Settings Response Quality isn't available when: Your survey end page redirects to a third party panel. Your data is stored in the Canada or European Union data centers. A response is incomplete. Response Quality will still work with other complete responses in your survey. When you buy responses with SurveyMonkey Audience, response quality is handled differently . Using Response Quality To turn Response Quality on: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select the gear icon from the top toolbar. Toggle on the Response Quality option. It may take a few minutes to scan your survey responses. If this is your first time using Response Quality, you'll see a confirmation message. Select Continue to enable the feature. Teams and Enterprise plans: If Response Quality is blocked, your primary admin may have turned off access . Ask your admin for access to use this feature. If your survey is still collecting responses, we’ll automatically rescan new responses for quality about every 24 hours. Once your responses are scanned, you can scroll through Individual Responses to find responses flagged as Poor Quality. If you agree that the response is poor-quality and want to remove it from your results, you can click Delete . This is permanent and cannot be undone. If you think that we’ve incorrectly flagged a response, click Remove flag to clear the flag and flag type. This also helps improve flagging accuracy in the future. Disabling Response Quality Response Quality analysis responses from all open-ended questions in your survey. If you turn it off, quality flags will be removed from any text responses in your survey. To turn off Response Quality: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select the gear icon in the toolbar. Toggle off the Response Quality option. Flag Types Our machine learning models are trained to look for several different types of poor-quality survey responses: Flag Type Description Profanity The survey response includes a curse word. Straight-lining Multiple questions have been quickly responded to with the same answer option. For example, the respondent chose option B for every question. Matrix pattern The respondent answered a matrix question in a pattern. For example, the respondent chose option A for row 1, option B for row 2, option A for row 3, and so on. Speeding The respondent spent less time on a page than expected. We use a typical reading speed to calculate the average time a respondent should spend on a page. Gibberish The response includes a text response primarily made of nonsensical words, like ""asdfjkl"". Length The response is significantly shorter than other responses. Not a full word The response includes a 1-character answer that's not a word. Copy-pasted answer The response matches the question text. Analyzing Response Quality When you export a CSV, XLS or SPSS file, your flagged responses will appear in a separate file. Your Response Quality file will show the respondent ID and flag types for responses identified as poor. You can also use the Response Quality filter to view responses marked as poor quality. Response Quality When Buying Responses Beta ! When buying SurveyMonkey responses via SurveyMonkey Audience , we automatically detect, delete, and replace flagged poor-quality response s with new complete responses. If you’re a Contribute or Rewards respondent and your complete response is flagged as poor-quality, you aren’t able to collect a reward or earn credits for taking the survey.

Allowing Multiple Responses,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/allowing-multiple-responses/,"Allowing Multiple Responses | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Allowing Multiple Responses Surveys with a Single Response Help Sending Surveys Collecting Responses Allowing Multiple Responses SurveyMonkey Allowing Multiple Responses Allowing Multiple Responses Surveys with a Single Response Multiple Responses lets people take your survey more than once from the same browser. This is handy if you expect survey takers to take your survey on a shared device, like in a computer lab or on a public kiosk. We use cookies to know if someone has already taken the survey and whether they're allowed to take it again. Allowing Multiple Responses You can enable the Multiple Responses collector option when you're using the Web Link collector, Website collector, or Social Media collector. To turn on Multiple Responses: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector to see the collector option. Click Multiple Responses . Select On, allow the survey to be taken more than once from the same device . Your changes save automatically. Response editing is limited when both Multiple Responses and Response Editing are on. People can only edit responses while they’re taking your survey—they can't edit responses after it’s completed. TIP! If you expect people to take your survey on a shared device or you’re manually entering survey responses , set the survey end page option to loop back to the beginning so the next survey is ready to go. Multiple Responses is Automatically On The Manual Data Entry collector and Kiosk collectors are meant to help you collect responses from multiple people, so there isn't an option to disable Multiple Responses. Surveys with a Single Response By default, Multiple Responses is turned off for most collectors, meaning the survey allows only one response per browser or email address. Web Link and Website Collectors When Multiple Responses is off and someone tries to take the survey again using the same browser, they'll see a message that they already took the survey. If the survey-taker's browser is set to clear cookies each time it's closed or they access the survey on a different browser or device, they’ll be able to take the survey multiple times. Email Invitation Collectors There isn't an option to allow multiple responses for email invitations. Each contact can only respond to an email invitation once. If you want a contact to take the survey more than once, create a new Email Invitation collector.

Using Inclusive Language,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/inclusive-language/,"Using Inclusive Language | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Main Considerations Gender Identity Sexual Orientation Race, Ethnicity & Nationality Help Creating Surveys Using Inclusive Language SurveyMonkey Using Inclusive Language Main Considerations Gender Identity Sexual Orientation Race, Ethnicity & Nationality After you create your survey and write your questions, you should take a moment to make sure that your questions are written inclusively and with sensitivity to the experiences of marginalized individuals. We’ve offered some suggestions below on the main considerations and common pitfalls that people run into with writing inclusive language. Main Considerations Use person-centered language It’s important to value people more than the specific rules we have around language. We should always focus on the person rather than specific aspects of the person as it is dehumanizing to refer to someone using just an aspect of their identity. Ultimately, our language should be used in a way that is respectful, caring, and informed by how the individual chooses to identify. When in doubt, put the word ‘person’/’people’ before any descriptors about an individual or community. Consider the context of your language Unless it is essential to what is being communicated, you should avoid identifying people based on characteristics such as their race, skin colour, national origin, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, and religious or spiritual affiliation. Do your research Inclusive language regularly changes because of the terms that people use to self-identify change. Regularly researching the appropriate language to use when referring to marginalized peoples and communities helps in speaking about others in a way that is both respectful and inclusive. Gender Identity When creating questions based on gender, you should consider whether it is even relevant. If gender is relevant, it is ideal to use gender-neutral terms wherever possible - unless you know the pronouns of the reader. Additionally, you should never assume the gender of an individual based on their appearance. ✅ Do: Offer a variety of gender options. ✅ Do: Use gender-neutral language and pronouns wherever possible. ❌ Don't: refer to people based on their perceived sex. Sexual Orientation When asking questions based on sexual orientation, it is essential to be inclusive of all relationship statuses and orientations. As well, it is important to consider if someone’s sexuality is even relevant to the content. Some individuals may self-identify using terms that were or are derogatory, as a means of reclaiming the meaning behind the language. These terms can only be used to self-identify and should not be used if you aren’t a part of the community the terms have targeted. ✅ Do: be inclusive of all relationship statuses. ✅ Do: use open questions to allow users to describe their sexual orientation. ❌ Don't: refer to someone’s sexual orientation as a ‘sexual preference’. ❌ Don't: use terminology that is only appropriate for members of a community to self-identify as, such as ‘queer’. Race, Ethnicity & Nationality When asking questions about race, ethnicity & nationality, it is essential to refer to individuals and communities using the terms they prefer to be referred to as. Unless it is essential and appropriate to the context, avoid referring to people based on their race, skin colour, and/or national origin. As well, it is especially important to avoid generalizations and stereotyping people based on someone’s skin colour, cultural background, or ethnic origin. ✅ Do: use the appropriate, accepted terminology for a community or individual. ❌ Don't: use words that have negative racial connotations, such as ‘blacklist’ or ‘slave’. ❌ Don't: make assumptions about someone’s nationality or cultural background based on their appearance.

How to Troubleshoot your Form Calculations,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/troubleshoot-calculations/,"How to Troubleshoot your Form Calculations | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Correct Formatting Matching Identifiers Piping to Piping Issues Restore Initial Value Help Advanced Features How to Troubleshoot your Form Calculations Apply How to Troubleshoot your Form Calculations Correct Formatting Matching Identifiers Piping to Piping Issues Restore Initial Value If you are receiving an error message within your text field or perhaps the value is not calculating to the correct value that you are trying to calculate, there are a few possibilities that may be causing these errors which are discussed in this article. The purpose of this article is to help you troubleshoot any errors that you may receive within the site. Correct Formatting Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of the function and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive and are spelt correctly Make sure that you have the correct number of brackets when using more complicated calculations. Correct formatting for each function type is being used See How to Set Up an Advanced Piping Expression for more information. Matching Identifiers You will need to ensure that the identifiers on the questions and the identifiers being used within the expression match exactly. These identifiers are case sensitive. It is also possible that when you are making changes to your form you forget to update the identifiers correctly. In order to ensure that your formula is calculating correctly, make sure that all questions you wish to calculate from are correctly piped into the expression with the correct identifiers. For more information, refer to How to Add an Identifier to a Question . Piping to Piping Issues In more complex scenarios you may wish to pipe a value (RE: Piped Value A) into a field within your form, whether it be from the same form or another form. The issue that can arise from this, is that you will not be able to use Piped Value A within another piping variable on the same page. For example, if the applicant provides their total expenses within a form and the value is piped into a second form. Once the expense total has been piped into the second form, you will not be able to immediately use it to perform calculations within the same page. You will need to create a new page. Therefore, the expense total will be piped in, the user can Save & Continue in the form, and the value can then be used within the second page. For more information and a bit clearer picture of what this looks like I would recommend, referring to How to Use In-Form Piping . Restore Initial Value When piping into Text Response or Hidden Value fields, a setting for Restore Initial Value is available. This is an important setting to enable when using Piping Variables or AEP as it will ensure that the field will always update when a change is made to the original field that the variable is pulling from. When this isn't enabled, after the applicant saves their form, their response will override the variable in the field. If they then make a change to their budget, for example, the total will remain with the first total that was saved. However, with Restore Initial Value, when they make a change to the budget, the total will continue to update accordingly.

Log in Sign up free Get the integration ! SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. With SurveyMonkey for Salesforce, you can build automations to trigger surveys and push data back to Salesforce records for in-context analysis. Create reports, dashboards, and automate flows to take action on feedback. When you integrate survey data with Salesforce, you can better understand, measure, and react to various customer interactions to improve the overall health of your business relationships. Salesforce blocked the creation of new workflow rules in February 2023. You’ll need to build new automations using Flows or use the Migrate to Flow tool . You can still activate, edit, and deactivate existing process builder and workflow rules. Before You Start Create your survey and set up your Salesforce object before you create your mappings. Learn more in our Getting Started guide . If your SurveyMonkey plan has Power and Casual seats, you need an Enterprise Power seat to access the integration. Learn more about seats and permissions . To avoid permission issues, it’s best to use a Salesforce account with a “system admin” profile. Learn more about recommended Salesforce permissions . Access the Integration All your mappings are saved to the Salesforce account you connect to. If the logged-in Salesforce account is deactivated, their mappings will stop working. Make sure to use an integration Salesforce account if possible. You can connect multiple accounts, including sandbox environments. This process leverages OAuth 2.0 for a secure integration. This process leverages OAuth 2.0 for a secure integration. To access the integration: Sign in to the Salesforce account you want to connect to SurveyMonkey. In SurveyMonkey, select the Products icon and select Apps & Integrations . Select Salesforce . Select Connect or Connect Sandbox to connect your Salesforce account. If you’ve signed in to Salesforce, we’ll automatically connect to your signed-in account. Refreshing Sandbox environments : Your Salesforce connection will break when you refresh your sandbox environment. To keep your mappings, reconnect to your sandbox environment, then copy the mappings from your old connection to the new one. Connect Your Survey to the Integration To connect the survey you want to map to Salesforce: After adding your connection, select your username. On the My Mappings page, select Connect Survey . Select a survey title from the dropdown. You can connect any survey you own or that has been shared with you with full access. Surveys are listed by title, not by nickname. Select Next . How Mapping Works Mappings send your survey data back to Salesforce. You'll create mappings to send specific data, such as a response or survey metadata, to a Salesforce object. You can choose from two mapping types: Managed package : This convenient, out of the box option sets up object mapping for you, so you don’t need to build a custom object or fields in Salesforce to hold your response data. The mapping creates a separate SurveyMonkey Response record for each question answered – so if your survey has 5 questions, it creates 5 SurveyMonkey Response records. Learn more about our managed package . Custom object mapping : If you need more custom mapping, you can choose to map responses to a custom or standard object. You can use three different mapping actions: Create a new record, Update an existing record, or Update or create a record. For each mapping type, you can also select the following options: Sync partial responses to Salesforce : Each time a survey taker clicks Next to move on in the survey, each answered question on that page will sync, rather than syncing upon survey completion Disable active assignment rules on creating or updating Salesforce records : Active assignment rules aren't re-applied when Accounts, Cases, or Leads records are created or updated. Object Mapping Actions The table below describes the mapping actions you can use in your custom Object Mappings. Mapping action What it does Create a new Create a new record in the Salesforce object you choose for each survey response. This option doesn't check to see if the record already exists—it just creates a new record each time. Update an existing Use a query mapping to find existing object records. If an object exists, it's updated. If the record doesn't exist, an entry is added to your Error Log. When you select this option, you can choose to Overwrite record fields that have existing values . This will replace existing data on your object. This can help you keep data current. However, if you need to revert these changes, you may need to manually update data later. Update or create Use a query mapping to find existing object records. If an object exists, it's updated. If it doesn't exist, a new record is created. Mapping Types After choosing your mapping action, you can set up your mapping. There are 3 mapping types you can use to map data to Salesforce. Mapping type What it does Available for Query mappings Query mappings tell the integration how to find existing records. You can use a custom variable to map to a specific Salesforce Record ID. ❌ Create a new record ✅ Update existing records ✅ Update or create records Survey content or data Map your SurveyMonkey response and other metadata to the appropriate Salesforce object fields. You can map any response field to one or more objects in Salesforce. If data fails to map, an entry is added to your Error Log. ✅ Create a new record ✅ Update existing records ✅ Update or create records More data Add more data to pass static values through to an object field each time a survey response comes in. For example, you can send a record type ID to designate which record type a survey should sync to if multiple exist for your object. Or, you can send a ""survey taken"" value, such as text or a checkbox, to track people who have taken your survey. ✅ Create a new record ✅ Update existing records ✅ Update or create records Create Mappings Build mappings for your survey. If you create mappings on a shared survey, the owner won’t be able to see your mappings. Create a New Record Create a new standard or custom object record every time someone submits a survey.

Then, enter a Variable label (a name for the variable so you can recognize it later). Then, select Save . When you’re done, select Build in Salesforce . We’ll create your outbound message in Salesforce. In Salesforce, create a flow to send your outbound message. Include the object you chose to trigger your survey. For example, if you chose the Case object to trigger your survey, create a flow for the Case object. Save and test your flow. You can immediately check your collector in SurveyMonkey to confirm an email invitation is pending. (Optional) Set up reminder and thank-you emails in your collector options . These can help increase your response rates by reminding respondents to take your survey. Updating Your Email Message To change your email message after your collector has received responses: In SurveyMonkey, go back to the Salesforce integration. Find the mapping for your survey. Select the 3 dots menu, then select Edit . Go to the Deployment Options step. Select Next . Edit your email. Don’t edit or send the email from your survey’s collector options. This can cause your custom data fields and the email automation to fail. Use the Salesforce integration to edit your email. Troubleshooting Email Invitations There are a few common errors with email invitations. Here are a few things to try to fix email invitation issues. Make sure your Salesforce account has permissions to send Outbound Messages. Check your Outbound Message in Salesforce. If you see an error, confirm that your endpoint URL is correct. This should be the link you got in the last distribution step in SurveyMonkey. Make sure the right fields were added to the Outbound Message. Some fields have similar names. Including the wrong field can cause the flow to fail. Test Your Survey and Mappings Take a test version of your survey to make sure your mappings work correctly. You can review mapping errors in the Audit Log. Select Mappings near the top of the page to see a survey's audit logs or errors. You can select the iAudit log icon to view your successful syncs or select the !Error icon to view an error description. Share Mappings with Your Team Shared Mappings give your team visibility into your survey mappings for better collaboration. Share Mappings To let your team access your survey and mappings: From SurveyMonkey, share your mapped survey with your team members. Make sure you give Full Access permissions to the Design Survey section. From the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration, go to My Mappings and click the Shared toggle for surveys you want to make available. Don't see the Shared column in My Mappings? Contact your CSM to activate the feature for your team. View Shared Mappings To view the team's shared mappings, hover over the down arrow next to Connected Accounts or My Mappings and select Shared Mappings . Team members can Edit Shared Mappings but can't view the deployment options page. To get the invitation URL, team members can contact the survey owner. Copy Mappings to Another Account If you build mappings in a Sandbox account, you can copy them over to a production account. To copy mappings: If you haven't already, add a connection for your other Salesforce account. On the My Mappings page, check the box for the survey you want to copy. Select Copy to Account . Select the account to copy your mapping to. Select OK . Common Questions Expand | Collapse How do I tie my responses to a specific record in Salesforce? First, check that you included Custom Variables in your survey mapping —either your survey field mapping or query mapping, depending on your mapping action. If your variables are mapped, the merge fields in your survey URL may need to be updated if your sending platform's {Merge field} differs from Salesforce. For example, Pardot uses different merge fields than Salesforce. Check the {Merge field} in the survey URL and replace it with the correct merge field from your sending platform. If you’re sending an Email Invitation, contact your CSM for assistance. Will survey responses collected before I connected the integration populate in Salesforce? No—only responses that you collect after the integration is connected can be mapped to Salesforce. How do we keep the responses sync active if the user that set up the mappings leaves the company? Don't delete a SurveyMonkey account or a Salesforce connection with an active Salesforce mapping, as this deletes the mappings permanently and survey data won't sync to Salesforce. Instead, if necessary, first reassign the SurveyMonkey account—this maintains all survey and integration data in the account. If the Salesforce connection a mapping is set up under will be deactivated, to avoid data loss, copy the mappings over to a new Salesforce connection/account. To copy mappings over to a new Salesforce account: Add a new Salesforce connection by logging into Salesforce and selecting Add account on the integration page (the Salesforce user you are logged in as will be added). Go to Connected Accounts and select the username of the original Salesforce connection. Select survey mappings and Copy to Account . Select the new Salesforce connection. The survey mappings are copied to the new connection. This doesn't include the sync data for original mapping. You can now safely delete the original Salesforce connection or deactivate the user.

Embedding Web Surveys in Zendesk Email Replies (app.usabilla.com),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/zendesk/zendesk-embed-email-replies/,"Embedding Web Surveys in Zendesk Email Replies (app.usabilla.com) | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Before You Start Create an Email Group Campaign Editing the Survey Format Adding Zendesk Placeholders as Custom Variables Adding Your Email Widget to Zendesk Help Zendesk Integrating with Zendesk Embedding Web Surveys in Zendesk Email Replies (app.usabilla.com) GetFeedback Embedding Web Surveys in Zendesk Email Replies (app.usabilla.com) Before You Start Create an Email Group Campaign Editing the Survey Format Adding Zendesk Placeholders as Custom Variables Adding Your Email Widget to Zendesk With app.usabilla.com , you can embed surveys into your Zendesk emails to learn how satisfied your customers are with your email responses. You can create a macro for this in Zendesk to use when replying to a ticket. You’ll need to edit your embedded survey so it displays properly in Zendesk and tracks any variables you want. Before You Start You'll need basic HTML knowledge to edit your survey for Zendesk. Create an Email Group Campaign To use a new GetFeedback campaign : In app.usabilla.com , go to Email . Create an email Group Campaign and customize it to meet your needs. After creating your campaign, copy the HTML code. Paste the HTML code into any code editor. To use an existing campaign : In app.usabilla.com , go to Email . Select Setup . Find the campaign you want to use, then select Widget Installation Instructions . Copy the HTML code and paste it into any code editor. Editing the Survey Format Edit the survey format and style to make sure it displays correctly in Zendesk. Remove all <table>, <td>, and <tr> tags. Replace each instance of ""display: block"" with ""display:inline-block"". Adding Zendesk Placeholders as Custom Variables Custom variables track customer data in GetFeedback. In Zendesk, these variables are called placeholders . For example, you can use placeholders to track your respondent’s name, role, and organization. To gather this data in Zendesk, you’ll need to add placeholders as custom variables to each link in your embedded survey. To add Zendesk placeholders to your embedded survey: In your code editor, find an <a> tag . Find the href element and link within the <a> tag. Add an & at the end of the link, Add the custom variable and placeholder: Enter a custom variable name. Add an = after the custom variable name. Enter the Zendesk placeholder code with 2 curly brackets on each end. Example: {{ticket.requester.name}} If needed, repeat to add multiple variables to the link. Repeat for each link in your survey. For reference, we've added a full example of how it will look down below using JSfiddle. Keep in mind that this example will need to be changed to match your own widget. Don’t use placeholders that may contain spaces or multiple words. For example, don’t use a single placeholder for name. Use a placeholder for both first name and last name instead. Make sure to use Zendesk placeholders that won’t contain a space. For example, use a placeholder for both first name and last name instead of using a single placeholder for name. Adding Your Email Widget to Zendesk Once you edit the HTML and add placeholders, you can add the embedded survey to Zendesk. You’ll create a macro and paste your embedded survey into it. Copying the Widget Zendesk doesn’t allow you to add HTML to your email, so you’ll need to use the rich text version. To copy your widget: Open the widget HTML in your web browser. Copy the entire widget. Creating a Macro in Zendesk Macros in Zendesk let you quickly add content to your email and set certain values in the ticket. You can also make widgets available to certain agents only. For your embedded email survey, create a macro that sets the comment mode to ""public"" and adds the widget to your response. Create a new macro in Zendesk. Paste your widget into the Rich content field. Add any other actions as needed. TIP! You can create multiple macros with different embedded survey campaigns to gather feedback for different brands, agents, or languages. Using Your Embedded Survey in Zendesk To add your embedded survey to your email, apply the macro to your response. Any survey responses are sent to GetFeedback.

Covid-19 Symptom Tracking Survey,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/symptom-tracking-survey/,"Covid-19 Symptom Tracking Survey | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Creating a Symptom Tracking Survey Sending a Symptom Tracking Survey Analyzing & Exporting Results Help Creating Surveys Survey Use Cases & Templates Solutions COVID-19 Covid-19 Symptom Tracking Survey SurveyMonkey Covid-19 Symptom Tracking Survey Creating a Symptom Tracking Survey Sending a Symptom Tracking Survey Analyzing & Exporting Results ENTERPRISE FEATURE: The COVID-19 Symptom Tracking survey is only available in the United States (US). If you're interested, contact sales . If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager. The COVID-19 Symptom Tracking and Risk Assessment survey is a tool to help your employees return to work safely. Start with a template with key questions to help make decisions about coming in to work. Based on people's answers, they'll be put into groups and you can set up a custom message to help guide their next steps. We have enabled our HIPAA security features for all SurveyMonkey accounts that have purchased the COVID-19 Symptom Tracking and Risk Assessment survey. Creating a Symptom Tracking Survey Start by setting up the survey in the Design Survey section. This is where you review the questions and add in the custom message with next steps for people to take after submitting their response. Design Your Survey Log into your SurveyMonkey account . Click Create Survey . Choose Start from a template . Choose the COVID-19 Symptom Tracking and Risk Assessment template. Once you have the basic template you can start customizing or adding new questions . You can customize existing questions by clicking Edit on the one you want to change. It's not possible to use skip logic with this template. Instead, we score questions (similar to quizzes ) and let people know next steps based on their answers. Each question in the template has point values assigned, and the total points determine the person’s score group. Each score group will see a different message at the end of the survey. The template has the points set up for each question, but you can edit the points depending on the needs of your organization. Points are assigned based on how people answer each question. For example, in the default template, people who answer Yes to ""Have you had any symptoms of COVID?"" or ""Have you had contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID?"" are placed in the Stop group . People who answer No to these questions are placed in the Go group .If you don’t make any edits, these default point values will apply. Assigning points to new questions If you add new questions to the survey, they will automatically have scoring turned on. If you ask questions about additional symptoms or risk factors, add points to the answer choices so that people's answers place them in the right group. If you don't want the new questions to be counted in the results, uncheck the box that says Score this question . This will remove the option to add points to that question. TIP! Once you open the template, Genius Assistant will pop up to guide you through the setup process. You can click through the prompts to make sure your survey is ready to go. Customize Messages Based on Answers To make sure people know next steps after taking the survey, customize the message that people see based on their score group. To customize the messages people see at the end of the survey: On the left sidebar of the Design Survey section , click Options . Click Score Groups . By default, people are put into 2 groups depending on their answers Go group: People with a score of 0. Stop group: People with a score of 1 or more points. Click the group you want to customize the message for. The point range is already configured for you based on the survey template. We don't recommend changing this. Write your Message title and Message . Click Save . You'll need to repeat the steps to customize messages for both score groups. Preview the Survey Preview your survey to make sure everything works the way you expect it to. You can take the survey and make sure the correct message displays based on your answers. If something doesn't look right, go back to the Design section and make changes. Sending a Symptom Tracking Survey When you're ready to send your survey, you can choose any collector type . For daily surveys that will get sent to the same group of people, we recommend using the email invitation collector . You can customize the invitation, track who has responded, and set it up to re-send on specific days and times. Add Your Contact List If you're using the Email Invitation collector, create a contact list to make sure the right people get the survey. This also gives you more control over your recipient list because you can add and remove people as needed. Set Up an Email Invitation Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Choose Email . Click Add Contacts . Click Contacts . Choose the group you want to send the survey to and click Add . Customize the Message section and write what you want people to see when they open the invitation. Click Next . (Optional) Choose any collector options . If you want people to get a copy of their responses, turn Email Results On. Click Next . Make your survey recurring If you want to automatically send the survey to the same group more than once, select recurring email . Then, choose the time and dates you want the survey to be sent. When you use a recurring email, it creates a new message in the same collector each time the survey is sent to that same group. If you add or remove people from your contact list, new messages will be sent to the most up-to-date list. TIP! If you want to set up a contactless survey for one time survey takers or visitors, use the QR code Web Link collector option. Choose How to be Notified About Responses There are two ways to get notified about survey responses: Instant notifications: Get an email after every survey response. Smart notifications: Get an email when a response meets certain criteria. How to set Smart notifications for responses indicating exposure to COVID-19 You can use Smart notifications to get an email when someone indicates that they may be exposed to COVID-19. To set up the notification: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click Manage Notifications . Click the Create button next to Smart notifications. If you're using the template, set the Trigger so that if the answer to questions about COVID-19 exposure is exactly yes, you will get an email. Click Save . Analyzing & Exporting Results Analyzing Results You can view all responses to the survey in the Analyze Results section. Click the Question Summaries tab to see a summary table with the survey taker's name and their Stop or Go status. To see a specific survey taker's responses, click their row in the summary table. Filtering for Responses By default, there are 2 filter rules set up for you: Go Group: People with a score of 0. Stop Group: People with a score of 1 or more points. Click the filters to turn them on or off. When a filter is on, only responses that match that response group will show. TIP! You can use other filter types to sort responses too. For example, filter by collector or respondent metadata to find people by name. Exporting Results To get the simplest view of your data, we recommend choosing the XLS All Responses Data when you export your results. To export individual responses: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Click Save As at the top of the page. Click Export file . Choose All Responses Data . Choose the XLS File Format and select Current view if you want to export with filters you turned on in Analyze. Click Export . Under Exports in the left sidebar, click the export to download the file to your computer. Sharing Survey Responses with Others If you want other people to view the survey data, you can share your exports or create a Shared Data page . The shared data page will include the summary table you see in Analyze. If you use a shared data page, people will be able to see data about individual survey takers.

Tracking Respondents,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/tracking-respondents/,"Tracking Respondents | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Sending Surveys Tracking & Anonymity Tracking Respondents SurveyMonkey Tracking Respondents Before you send your survey, decide if you want to track who’s taken your survey or if you want to keep responses anonymous. You need to set up your survey to track respondents before you send it out. It's not possible to start tracking responses after the survey is sent. Ways to Track Respondents Tracking Method Description Email Invitation Collector (Recommended) Sending an Email Invitation is the best way to track respondents . An Email Invitation lets you track: How many people opened your email How many people clicked through to the survey Who responded to your survey Web Link Collector When you use a Web Link collector to send your survey, you can use these tracking options: Add the Name or Email address question to your survey design and make it required so people must submit an identifier with their survey response. Add Custom Variables to your survey design to pass known information through a survey link and into your survey results. If you have an Enterprise team with SSO enabled, turn on Respondent Authentication . This means respondents need to log in through SSO to access your survey and their profile information is tracked with their response. Text Message Collector ( Enterprise only ) A text message collector tracks the number of texts you sent, whether any phone numbers bounced, the number of responses you received, and individual response status from the collector’s Overview and Recipients tabs. Recipient phone numbers aren't included in Analyze Results, so we recommend using custom data to see identifiable info like first name, last name, or other useful data. IP Address By default, most collectors track the IP address of your respondents as response metadata. However, if you turn on Anonymous Responses , your respondents’ IP addresses won't be tracked. If you want to track other identifying information, make sure to also choose another tracking method.

Likewise, if the event is related to users, you'll only see mapping actions that push user information. The program selected in the automation is also important - if the event is for program X, you'll only see mapping actions for that program. When you are creating your Action you will see pre-set fields that you selected in your Automation: Program Name (if applicable) SurveyMonkey Apply Object These actions are also accessible from the Mapping Actions tab. Column Description # The ID of the element This is a unique ID of the automation and can be useful for troubleshooting purposes Title The name of the Mapping Direction Identifies whether the action is a Push or Pull of data SM Apply Object - Organization - User - Application - Application - Task - Decision - Recommendation - Review Salesforce Object Identifies which object the information will be synced with, in Salesforce Where used The number of places where the mapping actions are being used. Hover over the field in the site to see more details Ellipsis Edit or Delete the Mapping from the site NOTE: You will not be able to delete an action that is connected to an automation. How to Create a Salesforce Mapping Action To begin creating your action: Create your Automation Within the Mapping Actions section of the Automation, click on the drop-down Click Create Mapping Action Enter the Name of the Action. Use the name of your Salesforce Object for easy organization in SurveyMonkey Apply Optional: Enter a Description Select to Push SM Apply data to Salesforce or Pull data from Salesforce to SM Apply Select the Salesforce Object Configure your mapping action. For more information see the sections on Push Mapping Action and Pull Mapping Action Save & Close your Mapping Action Add the action to your Automation Save & Close the Automation Some of the selections you make in your Automation will be pre-populated into your Action for easy reference. Push Mapping Action Field Mappings This section is for choosing which particular fields you want to map between the source and destinations objects. Required Salesforce fields may be found in PUSH actions and will appear automatically. Setting Description Unique The unique field, if selected, will cause the system to check to see if an object already exists with the same value. This field is also known as an ""upsert"" field. Here are a few things to take into consideration when making a field mapping Unique: - Multiple fields can be specified as unique and then the match must be successful in all specified fields - All unique fields must have a value in order for the sync to work. - SurveyMonkey Apply does a search on the fields the first time the action runs. > If it does, it will update the existing object rather than create a new one, thus ensuring that only one record in Salesforce has that value. > If we find more than one SF object, it will fail as we have no way of knowing which object to update. > This is commonly used with email addresses or IDs to make sure that duplicate records aren’t created for the same object. - This is case insensitive. If the field changed from “apply@surveymonkey.com”' to 'Apply@surveymonkey.com”' then the field will be updated; a new one would not be created. Apply Field Select what data from the application you want to sync: Available Apply Fields include: - Form Responses - Basic Fields about Application and Owner - Application and Applicant Custom Fields - Custom: use specified Default Data option The fields available will be dependent on the SurveyMonkey Object that is selected. Salesforce Field Select the Salesforce field that data will be pulled from, into the SM Apply field. Default Data Specifying a default value for the data will replace the value of a field with the value specified IF the source field being mapped doesn’t have a value. If mapping “Custom - use specified default data option” as described above, the default data is always used. Relationship Mapping We support Lookup fields, both optional and required, along with Master-Detail fields. For more information see Salesforce's help documentation on Relationships Among Objects . This is found at the bottom of the Create Mapping Action area of the Push Action. You can choose to create a relationship between an already existing Apply Action and the Salesforce Field. The object must be the same in order to create the relationship, otherwise, it will show an error: Default data is often used to specify the RecordType ID string if applicable. For more information on locating the Record Type ID in Salesforce, you can refer to Salesforce's help documentation on How to Find the ID of a Record Type . File Attachments If the selected Salesforce object type supports it, and if it is a Push action, you will be able to specify any file attachments that should be synced. File attachments are synced separately from the fields themselves, and the newly created Attachment object in Salesforce will be linked to the created record. You won’t be able to see your attachments in Salesforce unless you've enabled the Notes and Attachments panel. Pull Mapping Action PULL Actions are very similar to PUSH Actions, however, we are pulling information from a Salesforce field into an Apply field. A PULL action will only occur when the selected Salesforce field matches the mapped, corresponding Apply field. This means that we need to have this information in Apply first. Field Mappings This section is for choosing which particular fields you want to map between the source and destinations objects. Setting Description Apply Field Select what data from the application you want to sync: - Available Apply Fields include: - Form Responses - Basic Fields about Application and Owner - Application and Applicant Custom Fields - Custom: use specified Default Data option The fields available will be dependent on the SurveyMonkey Object that is selected. Salesforce Field Select the Salesforce field that data will be pulled from, into the SM Apply field. Default Data Specifying a default value for the data will replace the value of a field with the value specified IF the source field being mapped doesn’t have a value. If mapping “Custom - use specified default data option” as described above, the default data is always used. Pulls typically occur on the creation of the submission or into a user’s eligibility form, however other use-cases can be satisfied. The Automation must be set up correctly and with the understanding of the limitations as described above.

How to Test Your CAS Single Sign On,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/test-cas-sso/,"How to Test Your CAS Single Sign On | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Testing Procedures Key Scenarios to Test Applicants are able to successfully sign-in through the SSO Unique ID (UID) is working to correctly match a returning user to their existing account Reviewers are able to sign-in successfully through the SSO (if configured) Additional Help Advanced Features How to Test Your CAS Single Sign On Apply How to Test Your CAS Single Sign On Testing Procedures Key Scenarios to Test Applicants are able to successfully sign-in through the SSO Unique ID (UID) is working to correctly match a returning user to their existing account Reviewers are able to sign-in successfully through the SSO (if configured) Additional Testing Procedures In order to properly test the SSO integration, login credentials for test accounts are required (at minimum, one per user group that is established with SSO). It is recommended that you have test users for each group in your site. These test users must be shared with your Customer Engagement Representative to help in testing and troubleshooting. Only applicants and reviewers should be coming into the Apply site via the SSO; there should not be any co-applicants or recommenders. The SSO integration should be configured at least two weeks prior to the site going live. Two weeks allows time to sufficiently test as well as troubleshoot issues. During this time Apply requires the SSO technical expert implementing the integration on your side, to be on hand to promptly adjust SSO integration configurations on the IdP as issues appear. Key Scenarios to Test Key scenarios you want to test for are: Applicants are able to successfully sign-in through the SSO Upon signing in as a test applicant through the SSO you will want to check in the administrative end of Apply that they were successfully added in to “Users”. You also want to check in “Users” that all information is being pulled into Apply correctly. I.E. the name of the user, and their email are pulled over and put into the correct fields in Apply. If further user attributes have been mapped you will want to check they have also successfully mapped over. The columns option in the manage user section can be used to add those additional applicant custom fields to your manage users page. When mapping additional attributes to SM Apply, you can add those custom fields to the table as columns as well. Click on the Columns option in the top right of the toolbar Click on Custom Fields Select the fields you wish to add Click done and the fields will be added as columns to the table Unique ID (UID) is working to correctly match a returning user to their existing account Once you have successfully signed-on with a test user, and created/started a submission, sign-out of the site and then sign back in as that same individual. Check to make sure it brings you back into that specific Apply account, with a submission already started. If it brings you in, and the work you had previously done as that applicant is not available you will want to check in the administrative end of Apply if there are now two user account profiles for the same test user. If this is the case there is an issue with the UID. Reviewers are able to sign-in successfully through the SSO (if configured) SSO integrations default all new users your Apply site to the Applicant role. In order to ensure your reviewers have the right access in SM Apply you will need to add these users into SM Apply prior to their first SSO sign-on. You can do this by going to Users tab and selecting Add User . Ensure the reviewers are added into the reviewer role. The reviewers should be brought to the reviewer summary page, not the applicant main screen. Additional In addition to testing that the sign-in components are working correctly, full tests through complete applications should be run using users coming in through the SSO, testing all potential submissions, links, tasks and resources ensuring everything is working as desired. If issues are discovered during initial testing of the SSO there are some key pieces of information required to help resolve the issue: the type of user being tested, the login credentials for that user, and the error message (if one is displayed). Screenshots of error messages are always encouraged.

Viewing Opted Out or Bounced Contacts Some of your contacts (recipients) may be labeled as opted out or bounced in Contacts , Email Invitation collectors, or Text Message collectors. What are Opted Out or Bounced Contacts? Opted Out All messages sent through SurveyMonkey are required to include info on how recipients can opt out and unsubscribe from future survey invitations. To comply with our Acceptable Uses Policy , please remove opted out contacts from SurveyMonkey Contacts within ten days. Expand | Collapse Email Invitations Any recipient who clicks an opt out link is labeled as opted out in your Email Invitation collector and Contacts. After someone opts out, you can’t send them messages via the Email Invitation collector. To change an opted out status, the email address owner can opt back in to start receiving future email invitations from all users. This is a global setting—it's not possible to opt in to a specific account. Text Messages Any recipient who replies STOP to your text invitation is labeled as opted out in your Text Message collector and Contacts. After someone opts out, you can’t send them messages via the Text Message collector. To change the opted out status, the phone number owner needs to reply START to the original text invitation. Bounced A hard bounce means there's a permanent reason an email or text can't be delivered. A hard bounce most likely occurs if the contact info is invalid (for example, it doesn't exist or contains a typo) or the receiving mail server is blocking our IP addresses or domains . Any recipient whose email address or phone number hard bounced a message is labeled as bounced in your Email Invitation collector or Text Message collector, and Contacts. If an email address or phone number bounced a message sent from any SurveyMonkey account, no one else with a SurveyMonkey account can send them messages. We monitor outgoing messages sent through Email Invitation collectors to ensure we meet industry standards regarding bounce rates. If you have a very high bounce rate, we may suspend your mailing privileges within SurveyMonkey. Viewing Opted Out or Bounced Contacts Email Invitations or Text Messages While you can add opted out or bounced contacts in the Send To field, we review the recipient list before an invitation is sent and remove recipients that previously opted out or bounced. As a result, your invitation may send to fewer recipients than you added. To view the specific contacts who opted out or bounced: Go to your collector’s Overview tab. Click the Recipients tab. Click All recipients and select the status from the drop-down menu. If you're looking at an Email Invitation, make sure All messages is selected. You can't remove recipients who opted out or bounced from existing collectors, but you can remove them from Contacts so you don't add them to future collectors. Contacts When adding or importing contacts, you can add email addresses that opted out or bounced to Contacts . But, the contacts are automatically labeled as opted out or bounced. To view and delete opted out or bounced contacts: Click your username in the upper-right corner. Select Contacts . In the left sidebar of Contacts, click Opted Out or Bounced . In your contact list, check the box next to the contacts you want to delete. Click Delete Permanently at the top of the list. Deleting contacts within Contacts doesn’t remove them from your existing collectors, but it will prevent you from adding them to future collectors.

The other features in this article are Enterprise add-ons —contact your Customer Success Manager to add it to your team. If you’re the Primary Admin of an Enterprise team, you can access the Settings section in My Team to set default settings and permissions for your entire team. Manage Collectors and Collector Settings You can set default collector types and collector options for your entire Enterprise team, control whether people can change these default selections, and allow or restrict the types of collectors your team can use to send surveys. The default settings are applied to all future collectors your team creates. Existing collectors—including recurring surveys —don't change, but can be edited to match the default settings. Collector Types Expand | Collapse Restrict collector types This Restrict Collector Types setting lets you choose the collector types your team can use to send surveys. If a collector type is disabled, your team will see it greyed out in the Collect Responses section.

Uncheck the collector types you don't want your team to use. Select the collector types you do want your team to use. At least one collector type must be selected. You can’t disable the Target Audience collector . Allow people to send surveys by text message The Primary Admin controls whether people on your team can send surveys by text message. By default, no one on the team has access to send surveys by text message. To let people send surveys by text message: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Settings . Click the Collector tile. Under Text Message Collector , click the toggle to Allow people to send surveys by text message . Select whether your Entire team or Specific people can send surveys by text message.

If you disable access later, team members won't be able to send or create new Text Message collectors, but they can see their existing collectors. Collector Settings Whether or not team members can change these settings in individual collectors depends on whether the default settings were locked in Settings or conflict within a web link collector . Expand | Collapse Respondent Authentication The Respondent Authentication setting on the web link collector is available to teams with SSO enabled. When Respondent Authentication is enabled, survey takers are required to log in through SSO to access the survey, and their responses are tracked with this SSO metadata. You can set the default Respondent Authentication collector option for all new web link collectors. Once you select a default setting, you can choose to lock it so no one on your team can change it. To set the team default: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Settings . Click Collectors . Under Respondent Authentication (Web Link Collector Only) , toggle Set a team default . Toggle Turn Respondent Authentication on or off by default . (Optional) Check Lock default setting so no one on your team can change your preferred setting. If the default settings for Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses are both On, the default options on web link collectors will update . Anonymous Responses The Anonymous Responses setting lets you control the level of anonymity for any collector type. Enabling this default setting helps enforce company policies or prevent users on the team from capturing info like Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You can set the Anonymous Responses team default to one of the following: Not anonymous —all available respondent info is included in results. Partially anonymous —applies to Email Invitations only. Custom data is passed through to results, but all other respondent info is excluded. Any other collector types default to fully anonymous. Fully anonymous —no respondent info is included in results. Once you select a default setting, you can choose to lock it so no one on your team can change it. To set a team default: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Settings . Click Collectors . Under the Anonymous Responses section, toggle Set a team default . Select a default anonymity setting— Not anonymous , Partially anonymous , or Fully anonymous . (Optional) Check Lock default setting so no one on your team can change your preferred setting. If the default settings for Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses are both On, the default options on web link collectors will update . How Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses work together Because the Respondent Authentication feature always records the SSO profile information for everyone that takes the survey, responses can't be anonymous when Respondent Authentication is turned on. So, while you're able to turn on both Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses by default in Settings, both of these settings won't actually be reflected in new Web Link collectors your team creates. Instead, Respondent Authentication will remain turned on, and responses won't be anonymous. If Respondent Authentication is unlocked and Anonymous Responses is locked, people in your team can turn off Respondent Authentication, and the Anonymous Responses setting will automatically update to match the locked default setting. What Your Team Will See Expand | Collapse Collector Options The team's default settings are automatically applied to new collectors. If the default setting is locked, team members can't change the setting. If unlocked, team members can change it, but we recommend keeping the default selected by your Admin. Anyone on the team can update existing collectors to match the team’s default preference, but if the default setting is locked, team members won't be able to change it back. If the default settings for Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses are both On, the default options on web link collectors will update . Available collectors Team members can see all collector types in the Collect Responses section.

Response Manager If a respondent asks you or someone on your team to erase their response data, you can search across your team and filter by Email Invitation and Text Message collector metadata to find and delete applicable responses. Depending on where you and your respondents are located, you may be required to respond to requests from people who ask to exercise their data privacy rights . To find and delete survey responses: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Settings . Click Survey response management. Click Search responses . In the new tab Response Manager , filter your team's responses by at least one of these criteria: Email , First name , Last name , or Custom field . (Optional) Filter your team’s responses by Date . Click Apply Filters . Click Delete Responses . Confirm you want to delete responses. Filters let you search for respondent metadata—results won't include responses where name or email was collected as survey data.

Measure Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with SurveyMonkey,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/csat-surveys/,"Measure Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with SurveyMonkey | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article CSAT Overview Creating CSAT Surveys Connecting to Apps Collecting Responses Analyzing CSAT Surveys Help Creating Surveys Survey Use Cases & Templates Getting Started Create and Send Surveys Measure Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with SurveyMonkey SurveyMonkey Measure Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with SurveyMonkey CSAT Overview Creating CSAT Surveys Connecting to Apps Collecting Responses Analyzing CSAT Surveys A customer satisfaction (CSAT) survey helps you understand how customers felt about a specific interaction or transaction, such as contacting support or making a purchase. You can use CSAT with other metrics to understand your customers’ experience with your brand. Continue reading to learn about templates, features, and business apps that can help you build and analyze your CSAT survey in SurveyMonkey. New to measuring CSAT? Learn more about CSAT and how it works >> CSAT Overview Typical CSAT surveys include a single-choice CSAT question and a follow-up open-text question. The CSAT question looks like the example below: Overall, how would you rate your satisfaction with our company? Very Satisfied (score = 5) Somewhat Satisfied (score = 4) Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied (score = 3) Somewhat Dissatisfied (score = 2) Very Dissatisfied (score = 1) Responses to this question determine your CSAT score . Typically, responses in the top 2 categories (Very Satisfied or Somewhat Satisfied) are considered positive. You calculate your CSAT score by adding the number of responses to Very Satisfied or Somewhat Satisfied, dividing it by the total number of responses, and multiplying the result by 100. Creating CSAT Surveys There are a few ways to build a CSAT survey in SurveyMonkey. Use a template SurveyMonkey provides several free, customizable templates to help you start measuring customer satisfaction. Check out our popular CSAT survey template that you can customize for your use case. Build a survey with AI Write a prompt and let AI build a custom survey for you. Build with AI can create a survey that uses a CSAT question and other customized questions based on your company’s needs. If you’re writing a prompt for a CSAT survey: Specify any questions you want to include in your survey, like CSAT or CES. Provide information about your company and the services you provide. Describe the information you want from your customers so you can filter your results later. Don’t include sensitive information about your company or services. Start from scratch Create your survey from scratch. Add your own questions, apply question settings, apply logic, and customize the design. We recommend you use the Matrix/Rating Scale question type for your CSAT question. Check the box to Make this a single-row rating scale . This adds weights to the answer options so you can view and filter by specific scores later. if you use our Salesforce integration (available on Enterprise plans), you can also send these weights to Salesforce. General guidelines for CSAT surveys No matter how you build your CSAT survey, there are guidelines you can follow. Expand the dropdown below to learn more: Consider adding a single follow-up question that every respondent can answer, regardless of what rating users chose in your CSAT question. You can filter your responses later based on the rating people chose in your CSAT question. Think about the goal of your CSAT survey before you start writing it. This will help you decide what questions to ask so you can get the best results. Think about the people who will take your survey. Do you need to add logic to only show some questions based on how people answer other questions? Connecting to Apps Connect your CSAT data to other business apps that you use regularly to automate manual actions and send your data where you need it, Integrating Your Data with Salesforce Add-on : Available as an add-on for Enterprise plans. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Enterprise plans can use our Salesforce integration to send surveys at key touchpoints and build a single source of truth for customer insights. Use Salesforce to send a CSAT survey after a case is closed, at the end of onboarding, and more. If you use our Salesforce integration , you can send email invitations to customers after they interact with your support team. For example, you can send your CSAT survey when a support agent changes a case status to Closed. You can also build reporting in Salesforce to turn survey insights into clear and comprehensive dashboards. Collecting Responses You can send your survey using any of our collectors , as long as they’re available on your plan. Here are a few options that work well with CSAT surveys: Collector type What it is Key features Email collector Create an email collector to send a customized survey invitation to contacts. Emails are a great format for transactional CSAT surveys, which you send after someone interacts with your team. - Embed the first survey question - Send reminder emails - Track email analytics - Track respondents with custom variables Web link collector Copy a custom survey link to send however you want. Survey links are flexible and let you choose the right time and place to share your survey. - Customize the survey URL ending - Customize the domain - Track respondents with custom variables TIP! If you’re sending a transactional survey (for example, after someone completes a purchase or calls your support team), you can use a web link collector and turn on the Multiple responses setting. This way, you don’t have to create a new web link for respondents who take your survey more than once. Analyzing CSAT Surveys Once you’ve collected responses, you can start analyzing results. Here are a few tips to help you understand your results: Understand your CSAT score To calculate your actual CSAT score, you can use our CSAT Calculator . This number is calculated as the total number of Very Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses divided by the total number of responses then multiplied by 100, or: (Number of satisfied customers (4 and 5) / Number of survey responses) x 100 = % of satisfied customers Example: 500 people responded to a CSAT survey. 68 were Very Satisfied (score 5), and 74 were Somewhat Satisfied (score 4). - Add the number of Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses to get 142. - Divide 142 by the total number of responses (500). You get 0.284 . - Multiply .284 by 100 to get 28.4%. This is your CSAT score. The equation would look like this: (142 / 500) x 100 = 28.4% If you used a single-row matrix/rating scale, you can view the average rating in your Question Summaries. However, this rating doesn’t use the same calculation as the CSAT formula above. You can use filters and compare rules to understand how people who chose a certain score responded to other questions in your survey. You can also filter by open-ended responses to identify specific keywords and phrases in your results. Use compare rules Use compare rules to view two or more answer options side by side. Compare rules can help you view responses to other questions in your survey based on the CSAT option they chose.

Changing the Font on Your Form,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/themes/form-fonts/,"Changing the Font on Your Form | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo Help Themes and Styles Colors, Images & Fonts Changing the Font on Your Form Wufoo Changing the Font on Your Form In the Theme Designer, you can define the font, size, style, and color for all the different text elements throughout the forms that have that theme applied. If, instead, you want to format specific text in your form (for example, if you want to bold one word), you'll need to use HTML formatting in the Form Builder, rather than the Theme Designer. To change the fonts on your form: Click Themes in the header of your account. From the Theme dropdown menu all the way to the left, select an existing theme or create a new one. Select Typography from the list of properties. Under Typography, select the text element you want to edit. For example, Field Title. Click AaZz to open the Font Picker and browse through the different fonts—there are several pages and categories to browse through. When you find one you like, click the font to select it and click Pick this Font . In the Size menu, choose a font size. In the Style menu, choose from style options like bold or italic. The style options available vary depending on the font you chose. In the Colors menu, choose a font color from the color picker, or enter your own hex codes. Click Save Theme . If it's a new theme you'll also have to name your theme. Apply the theme to any of your forms or reports. There are three types of fonts to choose from: Font Type Description System fonts These are fonts that are already available on everyone's computer, so they'll load the fastest when people access your form. Bell and Whistle fonts Bell and Whistle fonts have a bit more flair. These fonts are served from Wufoo's servers, so when someone loads your form, their browser must download these fonts at that time. Because of this, your form might take a little longer to load than if you were to pick a system font. Typekit Fonts If you have a Typekit account, you can add fonts from one of your pre-made font kits into the Font Picker so you can use them for different elements in your themes.

Building a Report,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/reports/report-builder/,"Building a Report | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo In this article Building Reports Layout and Theme Previewing, Sharing, and Downloading Reports Help Entries and Reports Building a Report Wufoo Building a Report Building Reports Layout and Theme Previewing, Sharing, and Downloading Reports Reports allow you to visually display the data you collected through your form and share the results with others. In order to create a report, you must have an existing form. Building Reports Creating a Report To create a report: Log in and go to Reports . Click + New Report . Under Select Data , choose the form you want to use—the one you want to pull entry data from. Add Widgets to your report. At the bottom of the page, click Save Report as you make edits. Go to Reports —click View to see the live report, or get the share link or embed code . Report Settings: Title, Description, and Export Setting Go to the Report Settings tab to edit the title and description of the report. You can also choose if you want to allow people to download (export) the report . If you edit the title of an existing report, it might affect the URLs of reports you've shared . Select Data: Choosing a Form and All Entries vs. Selected Entries Go to the Select Data tab to choose the form you want the report to be based on. Each report can only show data from one form—you can't merge data from multiple forms into one report. But you can create multiple reports for one form. You can choose to use All Entries in your report or just use Selected Entries . Choosing Selected Entries allows you to filter the data you use by creating one or more conditions. Select Data: Creating Conditions to Filter Report Data You can create a report based off only some of your entry data. For example, if you have a field in your report asking someone to choose the department they work in, you can create a report that only includes entries from that department. To filter the data you want to use in your report: Log in and go to Reports . Under your existing report, click Edit . Click the Select Data tab. Choose selected entries from the first drop-down menu. Choose if you want any or all conditions to be true. ANY is the same as the OR operator and ALL is the same as the AND operator. Create your conditions. You can filter results by how people filled out the different fields in your form and by entry info. To add multiple conditions, click the green plus sign to the right of a condition. At the bottom of the page, click Save Report . TIP! You can limit your report to a specific time period by creating a condition using the Date Created attribute in the Entry Info section of the drop-down menu. Learn more: How To Create a Time-Based Wufoo Report Widgets: Adding Widgets & Widget Settings Widgets are the building blocks of reports. They visualize and organize the data you collect through your form into charts, graphs, and tables. Layout and Theme In the Add Widgets tab, you can choose from four different layouts that let you arrange your widgets into three zones. Within each zone, you can drag and drop your widgets in whatever order you want. To change the logo, colors, fonts, and background of your report, you can apply the same theme you used for your form. You can select the theme for a report from the Report Manager . Previewing, Sharing, and Downloading Reports Previewing a Report When you're editing a report, the report preview doesn't pull in real entry data from your form—we just show you generally how the report will look with fake, static data in the widgets. It's also only about 75% of the size of a live report to make it easier to build reports on smaller screens like laptops. To preview your report: Go to Reports . Beneath the report you're working on, click View . Keep that tab with your live report ready and waiting. Open a new tab and edit your report. As you edit and save changes to your report in that tab, refresh the tab with your live report to see how the settings affect how your data displays. Sharing a Report You can share your report with others or embed it on your site by clicking Widgets from the Report Manager. Downloading a Report In the Report Settings tab, you can choose to allow others to download (export) the report. This adds an Export Data button to the upper-right corner of your live report. Why doesn't my report show any data? Reports don't have any widgets by default, so it's possible to create a blank report if you haven't added any widgets yet. If you're only using Selected Entries in your report, make sure your conditions are set up right. If you edited your report's title after sharing it, the link to your report might have changed. You'll need to share your report again.

Log in Sign up free You can export your survey results as an XLS spreadsheet and open your survey results in Excel. See example exports » To export your survey results: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Save As at the top of the page. Select Export files . Select an export type: All Summary Data or All Responses Data . Choose XLS , select your export options, then select Export . To download your file, select Exports from the toolbar, then select the export. Exports are stored in the Exports for 14 days. Summary Data Summary Data exports organize survey results by question. Depending on question type , the XLS export includes presentation-ready tables with: The text of the question and answer options The response count, percentage per answer choice if it was a drop down or multiple choice question, and a corresponding chart The number of respondents who answered and the number who skipped the question Make sure to select include open-ended responses when exporting to see answers from Comment Boxes, Textboxes, or questions where Other was an answer option or comment field. Responses Data Responses Data exports organize survey results in a spreadsheet where each row contains the answers from a given respondent. The question type determines how the data is reported in the spreadsheet. Condensed Columns vs. Expanded Columns This setting only affects questions with a single answer choice allowed. By default, spreadsheet columns are condensed . This means instead of listing each answer option in separate columns, only the answer the respondent chose is listed in the cell—all responses are listed in one column. If you choose to expand columns, every possible answer choice for a given question is listed in its own column. If a respondent chose a particular answer option, it's written in the cell under the appropriate column. If a respondent did not choose a particular answer option, the cell under that column is blank. Actual Answer Text vs. Numerical Value By default, if a respondent chose a particular answer option, your actual answer text is used in the cell. You can choose to have your answer choices converted to numerical values . The values assigned to your answer choices correspond to the order in which they appear in your survey design. 1 is assigned to the first answer choice in the list, 2 is assigned to the second answer choice in the list, and so on. If you added Other as an answer choice, it's assigned 0. For Rating questions, we use the weighted value assigned in the survey design as the numerical value for each answer option. You'll need to build your own key to see which answer choice belongs to which assigned number. For imported SurveyMonkey Audience demographic info, the weights assigned correspond to the order of the answer options in your data tables. Spreadsheet Organization Each row in the spreadsheet contains the answer set from a given respondent, allowing you to do your own analysis per question. Column Definition Respondent ID The unique number associated with the respondent. Collector ID The unique number for the collector. Use the CollectorList file, also included in your export, to match this ID to a collector's title. Start Date Time stamp when the respondent accessed the survey. End Date Time stamp when the respondent submitted or last modified the survey. IP Address The respondent's IP address, if you used IP tracking . Email Address Available if you used the Email Invitation collector. First Name Available if you added this to the contact and used the Email Invitation or Text Message collectors. Last Name Available if you added this to the contact and used the Email Invitation or Text Message collectors. Custom 1-6 Available if you added this to the contact and used the Email Invitation or Text Message collectors. A formatting note—you'll always see a column for custom 1. Columns for custom 2-6 aren't shown unless you're using them. Question 1 The first question of your survey. Blank cells are answer options the respondent didn't select or questions the respondent didn't answer or skipped due to logic in your survey design. Questions with multiple rows, columns, or fields of answer choices span across multiple columns in the spreadsheet with each row, column, or field in its own column. Custom 7-50 Available if you added this to the contact and used the Email Invitation or Text Message collectors. Columns for custom 7-50 aren't shown unless you're using them. TIP!

For example, you can use the same customer satisfaction survey for a year and create a new Collector each time you send it out. Then, use Data Trends to see if the number of satisfied customers has gone up or down over the course of the year. From Analyze Results , click the Insights and Data Trends tab, between Question Summaries and Individual Responses. Charts The chart at the top of the page (labeled Responses ) represents the total number of responses submitted to the survey in each time interval. To customize the Responses chart, you can: Change the chart type Choose the preferred time interval Zoom in on a shorter time frame Below the Responses chart, a chart is generated for each survey question. These charts show you how different answer choice selections have changed over time. There are several ways to customize these charts: From the Chart Type drop-down menu, choose to display the data as a Column Chart , Area Chart , or Line Chart . By default, the y-axis represents the absolute response count. From the Display Options menu, you can choose to switch the axis to represent response percentages instead. From the Trend by... menu, you can change the time interval represented by the horizontal x-axis. From the Zoom menu, you can choose to zoom in on a shorter time frame. Hover over a section of a stacked chart to view the response count or percentage. Question Types Insights and Data Trends will generate charts for all close-ended question types, excluding the Matrix of Dropdown Menus and Slider question types. Default Time Intervals The horizontal axis of the bar charts will default to the time interval that makes the most sense with your data set: hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year. The default interval is determined by the following criteria: Time Between First & Last Response Time Interval ≤ 24 hours Hour ≤ 30 days Day ≤ 6 months Week ≤ 3 years Month ≤ 10 years Quarter > 10 years Year You can change the time interval from the Trend by... drop-down menu. The interval options available are determined by your data, if your survey's been open for years, you may not see the hourly option. You can change the time zone on the My Account page. Filter, Compare, or Show Rules Filter , Show and Compare rules carry over to the Insights and Data Trends tab. However, the Compare rule acts as filter rather than a tool to cross-tabulate the results.

This article will walk through the various sections of the Form Builder and different actions you can take within the Form Builder. How to Access the Form Builder To access the Form Builder: Go to the Workflow Click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the stage Click on the Attached form to the task you are trying to edit How to Add a New Question Adding questions to your form is how you will build your form(s). You can add questions in two ways. To add a question to the middle of the page : Click on the Questions tab on the left side of the Form Builder Click and Drag the question type you wish to add and place it wherever you need to within the page you are on. To add a question to the end of the page : Click on the Questions tab on the left side of the Form Builder Double Click on the question type to have it added to the very end of the page you are on. Form Title and Description The Form Title is what your users see when they enter the form. This is different from the Task Name which the users will view when they are in the main application page. Edit the Form Title When a form is first created, the form title inherits the form name. However, if you wish to edit it: Click on the edit icon next to the form title. Enter the new title you wish to give within the Title field. Click anywhere on the page to save the changes. Add/ Edit the Form Description The Form Description can be extremely useful if you wish to provide details and instructions to your applicants in regards to the steps they need to take to complete the form. Commonly administrators will also enter their own contact details in case an applicant has any questions while filling out the form. To add or edit the Form Description: Click Edit Description. Enter the description you wish to add to the form. Optional: Click Open Visual Editor to customize the styling of the form description. Click Done. NOTE: If you have multiple pages in the form, the Title and Description will appear at the top of every page. Form Title Restriction The initial form title when creating the form cannot be longer than 50 characters when creating the task. Change it later to include: More than 50 characters HTML CSS HTML can be entered directly into the Title and Description fields and it will be observed within the live version of the form. How to Save your Form Saving your form is required for your changes to be visible to users when they enter the form. There are three ways in which your form is saved: Draft Saved automatically Clicking the Save Button but remain in the form Click Save & Close to return to your Workflow NOTE: Changes saved as drafts (auto-saved) will not be visible to other users completing the form until Save or Save & Close has been selected. How to Preview your Form Click on Preview will open a new tab where you can test your form. The form will appear almost exactly as it would to your user. Since you are previewing the form as an administrator, you will also see any Hidden Questions or JavaScript Questions; however, these will not be visible to your regular applicants. NOTE: If your form contains Piping Variables used to pipe information from another form, or to pipe information specific to the user, these piping variables will not work correctly within the preview and the field will appear blank. If you wish to test your Piping Variables we would recommend using a test application. For more information in regards to this you can refer to How to Test your SM Apply Site: Testing Forms . How to Add a Page Label By default, pages are labelled by ""Page #"" based on the page placement in the form. Page labels allow you to create named pages of your form that can then branch or jump users to. Page labels do not have a character type restriction, eg., #@!&$%, or character limit. To change the page title: Click on the Page tab within the form’s editor. Under ""Page Label"" input your new page title. The new name will apply to that page. Repeat this step for each page. TIP! Use Page Labels if each page in your form will have a different purpose, for example, Contact Information, Educational Information, Budget, etc. How to use the Bulk Editor In the case that you have a long list of choices or variables, or a list that you'll be re-using often throughout your many forms, it may be useful to use the bulk editor. The bulk editor converts lists into choices/variables/rows while giving you the option of saving them for use on any future question. The Bulk option is available under all ""Choices"" and ""Variables"" on the left-hand floating editor box. Section Description Load Preset Select from 1 of 23 available presets. Save a Preset If a preset is not available, you can create one for later use. Editor You can edit a preset after the fact. However, any changes made will not save unless it is as a custom preset. Additionally, you can also save custom bulk lists. To create a custom bulk list: Click on the “Bulk” button when adding choices, variables, rows or columns to a question. Once the dialogue appears, write or paste your list into the text field. Make sure that each item in the list is on a separate line. Enter a name for your list and click Apply . Save a Custom Preset Section Description Custom Preset Enter the name of the present you'd like to use. Preset Choices Information typed into here will save in the custom preset. Note that, despite the fact it is preset you can still alter it after the fact. How to use the Visual Editor The visual editor allows you to add text, videos, links, and more to your form. The editor is available in the Question Titles, and Form and Question Descriptions, but not for the Form Title, Choices or Variables. To access the visual editor: Click on the question you wish to edit In the Options tab, click on the question title or extra description text box Click on the Open Visual Editor button beneath the text box. Edit your text using the options available in the visual editor. Click OK . Click the Source button within the visual editor to input HTML or CSS. While Javascript can be placed in the source, we recommend that you place it in a JavaScript question type instead so that you can find it easily if you need to revisit the form in the future.

Previewing lets you see how your survey will look to respondents. You can make sure logic works the way you want it to, and invite people to review and comment on your survey before you send it. There are limits to editing a live survey , so it's helpful to edit your survey design before collecting responses. If you want to test your collector options, you can create a test collector. Responses to your survey preview aren't recorded. Previewing Your Survey Preview and Review Once you’re done designing your survey, click Preview survey to open a preview of your survey in a new tab. From that page, you can: Take your survey as a respondent would in the middle section of the screen without saving the response Review the Survey overview and logic paths, and add comments Invite others to comment via Share for review , or view existing comments Review the Survey Genius details Preview how your survey looks in the Desktop , Tablet , and Phone device views You can choose the Survey Format to present your survey to respondents from the Design survey tab.

Page Rules,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/build/page-rules/,"Page Rules | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo In this article Requirements Actions Using Multiple Page Rules Help Build a Form Form Settings, Rules & Logic Page Rules Wufoo Page Rules Requirements Actions Using Multiple Page Rules You can create rules and conditions to build a dynamic form. Page Rules allow you to skip people to different pages in your form when certain conditions are met. This allows you to create custom paths for the different types of people filling out your form, making sure they only see pages relevant to them. To create Page Rules: Log in and go to Forms . To the right of the form, If you're using legacy Wufoo, hover over Edit then click Add rules . If you're using the new Wufoo experience , click the . More icon then click Form rules . Click the green tab for Page Rules . Create a condition. Choose an action: Click the drop-down menu that says Page 1 . At the bottom of the page, click Save . At the top of the page, click View Form to test it out. Requirements To use Page Rules, you need either a multi-page form or a payment-enabled form . Actions Action Description Skip to Page Number Have people go to a particular page, any page number you'd like—forwards or backwards in the form. Be careful not to create an endless loop when skipping backwards! Skip to Payment Summary Send people straight to the payment page. Skip to Confirmation Page Skip people past all the remaining pages in the form, including any payment page, and go straight to the confirmation page. TIP! When you have Page Rules in place on a multi-page form, if people click the previous link on the form page, they'll follow the same path they came from—someone that jumps from page 2 to page 5 will return to page 2 if they click on the previous button. Using Multiple Page Rules You can set up multiple Page Rules to create multiple paths for your form. See the example in the next section. If any Page Rules conflict, your form will only follow the rule that comes last (the higher number) in the list. For example, let's say you're asking someone what their payment method is and you set up two rules: Rule 1 sends people who choose credit card to page 2 to answer some follow-up questions, and rule 2 skips people who choose credit card to the payment summary page to check out. Your form can't do both, so it'll skip anyone who chooses credit card to the payment summary page because rule 2 (the higher number) comes after rule 1. Example Let's say you allow customers to make payments by check or credit card. Customers paying by credit card should be sent to the payment summary page so they can enter their credit card details and complete their payment, while customers paying by check need to know the address they should mail it to and should not see the payment summary page. First, create a Page Rule. Make the condition people who pay by credit card and the action skip to payment summary. Now, for people paying by check, send them to the confirmation page. And to make your form really smart, add a Section Break field to your form with your mailing address. Then add a Field Rule to only show this field to people who are paying by check.

How It Works When your team has Divisions —sub-groups within your team that can be managed independently of one another—each division can have its own division library with its own set of assets. A division library allows each division to have unique assets that are different from the assets in the team library and other divisions. Division members can use the assets from the team library or their division library, which ensures all surveys meet either the team's or division’s unique branding needs. The assets that team members can see, manage, and use depend on their role , if they belong to a division, and whether those assets have additional default settings or restrictions. Only the Primary Admin and Admin have full access to view, add, and manage the team library and all division libraries. Primary Admins and Admins can: Division Admins can: Users can: View, add, or manage assets in the team library (as described earlier in this article) or any division library Click a division name to view the assets in that division library and set defaults for that division Set team and division defaults Allow Division Admins to override the asset settings for their division Create surveys without any restrictions View assets from the team library View, add, or manage assets for the division libraries they manage Click a division name to view the assets in that specific division library Set defaults for the divisions they manage, if given permission by the Primary Admin Create surveys using the assets they have permission to use from the team library or division libraries they manage View the assets from the team library and division library, if they are assigned to a division Create surveys using the assets they have permission to use from the team library or division library Expand | Collapse Division Libraries vs. Team Library The team library is for everyone on the team. A division library is only available to the people assigned to that division. If someone is not assigned to a division, they only have access to the team library. If an asset is Set as default for a Division, that setting overrides the team default. Navigating the Library On the Library page, there's a Library dropdown to navigate between the team and division libraries. The Filter button lets anyone narrow down their library by item type. Primary Admins, Admins, and Division Admins can also Filter to display items from specific libraries. Setting Default Division Assets From the Library page, Primary Admins and Admins can click Set team defaults to set a default logo, theme, template, or intro text for all new surveys the team creates. Primary Admins, Admins, and Division Admins can Set division defaults . If an asset is Set as default for a Division, that setting overrides the team default. After adding a default team or division asset, Primary Admins and Admins can set further restrictions. Assets can have: No restrictions—team members can remove or replace the default asset Restrictions to logos or themes in the library—team members can choose to replace the default asset with another asset in their library Restriction to only the default asset—team members can only create surveys with the default asset There's also a toggle to Allow Division Admins to override the asset settings for their division . If the Division Admin is given permission, they can add and manage assets for their division libraries. If they aren’t allowed, they can only view their division libraries. When division defaults differ from the Team default, Primary Admins, Admins, or Division Admins can click Reset to Team Defaults to revert the asset and its restrictions back. TIP! You can select the size and position of a default logo and choose to restrict whether users can edit your selections. Creating Surveys The assets that team members can use for creating new surveys depend on their role, if they belong to a division, and whether those assets have default settings or restrictions on them. When creating surveys, Division Admins and Users can only see the assets they have permission to view and use. Primary Admins and Admins don’t have any restrictions as they create surveys so they can add new assets to libraries as they need. If an asset is set as a default, it's automatically added when a new survey is created. Depending on the restrictions set, the team member may or may not have the ability to remove or update the asset.

Benchmarking,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/insights/benchmarking/,"Benchmarking | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Viewing Benchmark Data Data Security and Privacy for Benchmarking Considerations for Benchmarking Help Insights Filtering and comparing results Benchmarking GetFeedback Benchmarking Viewing Benchmark Data Data Security and Privacy for Benchmarking Considerations for Benchmarking Benchmarking helps you quickly compare your audience and responses to other groups in your industry. Viewing Benchmark Data If you don’t see any data on the Benchmark page, your GetFeedback admin may have opted out of benchmarking. In app.usabilla.com , select Benchmark from the left-side menu. You can view benchmarks for the following data: Emotional trendline : Compare your average mood score over time with others in your industry. Net Promoter Score™ (NPS) : If you collect NPS scores in your web button, compare your scores with others in your industry. We also show a breakdown of the NPS scores. Browser, Operating System, and Device Usage : Compare the common platforms and devices your audiences use. You can view a ranking list or a donught chart. Filtering Benchmark Data and Viewing Different Industries Use the panel on the left side of the screen to filter your data by industry, date range, device, browser, and operating system. We won’t show data for an industry if we haven’t collected enough responses. Data Security and Privacy for Benchmarking We take the following steps to keep your data private: We group all accounts who participate in benchmarking by the industry they operate in to keep data anonymous and representative.. We show all benchmarking scores and statistics are shown by industry so it can’t be traced back to individual accounts or websites.. We only show scores for generic questions, such as mood and NPS scores, to avoid sharing recognizable results. We require you to opt in before we include your data in benchmarking. We only show data after a large number of accounts have provided responses to help anonymize results. Considerations for Benchmarking Keep the following in mind when reviewing benchmark data: We use a complex algorithm to provide the best data possible, but benchmarking data shouldn’t be used as a scientific resource. Benchmarking data works best to gain a high-level understanding of results in an industry. Many factors can impact your scores and your respondents’ platforms, such as your target audience, industry, and culture. Benchmark data may not be representative of your company’s success if you’re comparing results to groups with different goals. Other companies may present their questions differently, which can affect their average mood score.

When making use of a feature that leverages artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in SurveyMonkey, remember to be transparent about this usage in your privacy notices. These features are usually clearly marked or you can read about them in this Help Center. You can use skip logic to disqualify respondents who don't agree with your privacy notice or practices. Privacy statements often include: What personal information you're collecting : Identify if you're making responses anonymous or tracking responses with email address, phone number, or other personal information collected in your survey or stored in your collector. How you plan to use the data : Say why you're sending your survey and what you want to do with the data collected. Whether you intend to share survey data : Clarify who will have access to the data.

If you're interested, contact sales . If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Does HIPAA apply to me? If you are a “covered entity” (as defined by HIPAA) and are using SurveyMonkey to collect or store protected health information (generally any information about the health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual, such as an individual’s name and/or contact details combined with information about health care that the individual received), then HIPAA likely applies to your use of SurveyMonkey. If you don’t need HIPAA but do need a higher level of security when using SurveyMonkey to collect or store information, check out the Enhanced Sensitive Data Protection feature . The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a United States law that regulates the collection and handling of “protected health information” (PHI). Certain organizations called “covered entities” and their business associates are required to comply with HIPAA. For SurveyMonkey, being ""HIPAA-compliant"" means that we offer a service that enables covered entities to collect and manage PHI through surveys in a manner compliant with HIPAA. As part of offering this service, SurveyMonkey ensures that it operates in a way that is consistent and compatible with those laws and SurveyMonkey's role as a business associate to a covered entity user. In accordance with our Terms of Use , SurveyMonkey only permits PHI to be collected by regulated entities if it is done through a “HIPAA-enabled account” with a business associate agreement (BAA) in place. However, SurveyMonkey does not require you to have a BAA if you are not regulated by HIPAA with respect to the PHI you collect in your surveys. HIPAA Features Expand | Collapse HIPAA Security Measures that SurveyMonkey Employs As required by HIPAA, we implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic PHI that we receive, maintain, and transmit on behalf of covered entities with respect to their HIPAA-enabled accounts. These safeguards include measures required by the Security Rule, such as: Regular risk assessments of systems to ensure that safeguards remain relevant and effective Assigned security team which is responsible for maintaining compliance with HIPAA’s security requirements Screening, authorization, and training of SurveyMonkey staff who come into contact with customer PHI Data backup plans Disaster recovery plans Systems regularly monitored, updated, and patched Incident response plan that includes reporting of security incidents to affected covered entities All communications with SurveyMonkey servers encrypted with SSL For more information, see our Security Statement . Feature List When you enable HIPAA-compliant features, the following features required by HIPAA are activated on your account. These features help covered entities to comply with their own HIPAA obligations: Security reminders : We remind users of their HIPAA obligations with in-product messages that appear whenever they perform certain sensitive operations on PHI (such as exporting survey data that could potentially be shared with third parties). Automatic logoff : We timeout user sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity. Logging : We log account access activity and a variety of events relating to HIPAA-enabled accounts by timestamp, identity (IP Address and/or account username), and event type. While there isn't a way to access these logs within your account—you can contact us to request logs. Enabling HIPAA Features SurveyMonkey offers a standard form BAA which meets the requirements of HIPAA. If you're interested in enabling HIPAA features on your account, please contact us . If you've already entered into a BAA with us, you can contact us to receive a copy of your BAA. Once an account is HIPAA-enabled, it cannot be reverted to a non-HIPAA account. If the BAA is terminated, your account will also be closed. See the Downgrades section below for more information. Downgrades Review the common questions below to understand how downgrades work for HIPAA-enabled accounts. Expand | Collapse Can I downgrade my HIPAA-enabled account or team to a lower plan type? No. Once you enable HIPAA-compliant features on your account or Enterprise team, it cannot be reverted back to a regular, non-HIPAA-enabled account. If you want to remove HIPAA-compliant features from your account, or if you want a lower plan, you must open a new account. Note that you can transfer surveys from your HIPAA-enabled account to a regular account, but you must be very careful not to transfer any surveys that contain PHI (we do not permit users to store PHI in regular accounts, and regular accounts are not covered by a BAA). What happens if I don't renew my HIPAA-enabled account or team? If you decide you no longer need to use SurveyMonkey and don't renew your HIPAA-enabled account, your account will be placed into a suspended state. While suspended, SurveyMonkey will preserve all data contained within the account and continue to treat it in accordance with the BAA. However, you will not be able to access your survey data or account directly (except for limited billing and account administration functions). SurveyMonkey will retain a suspended account for a period of time in order to provide you with an opportunity to unsuspend your account by renewing it. If your account is suspended and you need access to your data or want to close your account, please contact us . At the end of the suspension period, SurveyMonkey will close your account and delete all data in it. What happens if I close my HIPAA-enabled account or terminate my BAA? If you close your HIPAA-enabled account or team, the BAA will terminate. If you terminate the BAA, then, subject to the terms of the BAA, your HIPAA-enabled account or team will be closed. Surveymonkey always provides you with an opportunity to save a copy of your survey data before your account gets closed. HIPAA Security Tips Once you enable HIPAA-compliant features on your account or team, follow these best practices when performing certain actions to help ensure that you're handling your data responsibly and securely. Action HIPAA Security Tips Exporting survey results If you download survey results to your own computer, please ensure that those downloaded files are handled appropriately since they contain PHI. We suggest that you secure those files by encrypting them and only transferring them under an encrypted connection. Sharing surveys with others When you share a survey, the people you choose to share it with will have access to view and possibly edit the survey, or access any collected survey responses. Remember to only share surveys in a manner consistent with your HIPAA obligations. Only share a survey with people who are authorized to work on that survey. Transferring a survey to another account If you must transfer a survey to a different SurveyMonkey account, ensure that you are absolutely certain that the receiving account is the one you intend to send it to. To transfer a survey, you must enter the exact username of that account. The transfer process cannot be undone without action by the receiving account holder. If your survey contains PHI, it is your responsibility to ensure that such PHI is only disclosed to an appropriate recipient. This means that if you transfer PHI to another account, it is crucial that that account must also be HIPAA-enabled. Collecting responses If you collect PHI in your survey, we recommend that you use a Web Link Collector . We do not recommend the use of an Email Invitation Collector. Email Invitation Collectors email survey invitations to contacts with a unique survey link tied to a contact's email address. If respondents are able to edit their responses , a contact of an email invitation could complete all or part of a survey and forward their unique survey link to someone else. This would allow the second contact to view the first contact’s responses, which may contain PHI. Sharing survey results Your survey results may contain PHI, so remember to only share survey results in a manner consistent with your HIPAA obligations. Only disclose results to authorized recipients. AI and Machine Learning (ML) Feature Access The Primary Admin controls access to most of the AI/ML features available for Enterprise team users, which can be changed in Enterprise settings . However, some features like Build with AI are not available for HIPAA-enabled accounts. Feature HIPAA default permissions Build with AI Not available.

Available file formats will depend on the previously selected File Type. For more information please refer to Accepted File Formats . Multiple Uploads Allow your applicants to upload multiple files within the same task. When you enable this you will also be able to set a minimum and a maximum number of uploads (attachments). This can be useful if you require a specific amount of files. For example, if your applicants have to upload exactly 5 images to support their application you can set the minimum and the maximum to be 5. Max File Size Set the Maximum size of the file you wish to accept. Your applicants will not be able to upload a file over this size. We typically suggest a maximum file size of 1000MB.

"Team Seats, Roles, and Permissions",https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/team-roles-permissions/,"Team Seats, Roles, and Permissions | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Seat Types & Roles Permissions for Full Access Seats Permissions for Contributor Seats Changing Someone's Seat Type or Role Help Teams & Enterprise Managing Teams Team Seats, Roles, and Permissions SurveyMonkey Team Seats, Roles, and Permissions Seat Types & Roles Permissions for Full Access Seats Permissions for Contributor Seats Changing Someone's Seat Type or Role TEAM ADVANTAGE AND TEAM PREMIER FEATURES: Read about roles within these specific team plans. If you have an Enterprise plan, go to Enterprise Team Seats, Roles, and Permissions. Your seat and role on a team control what permissions you have within your account and how you can work together with your team. Seats and Roles The Primary Admin invites people to fill a seat (an account) and assigns the seat a role. Someone's seat and role set the permissions within their account and what they can do on the team. Seats There are 2 seats available on Team Advantage or Team Premier Plans : Full access seats have full access survey permissions and can share surveys . Full access seats can be added one by one. Contributor seats have limited survey permissions and focus on one section of shared surveys, like just the Analyze section. Contributor seats can be added in bundles of 2 at a time. Roles The seat determines the role someone can have on the team. Role Description Primary Admin Full Access seat. The person who created the team. They have full survey permissions and full admin permissions, letting them manage billing for the team and manage seats . Full User Full Access seat. They have survey permissions to create, send, and analyze surveys, but have no admin permissions. Analyst Contributor seat. They have limited survey permissions—full access to analyze the results of surveys shared with them , can view and comment on the survey design, and view the collectors used to send the survey. Viewing Seats and Roles Primary Admins can view the seat and role of everyone on the team from the Manage Users tab. To go to the Manage Users tab: Select My Team from the main navigation. Select Manage Users . Permissions for Full Access Seats Here's what people in each role can do on your team: Primary Admin Full User Edit and manage team billing ✅ ❌ View team billing details on the My Account page ✅ ❌ Edit the team name ✅ ❌ Access the Team Summary ✅ ❌ Add seats ✅ ❌ Reassign or delete accounts ✅ ❌ Send copies of surveys to all team members ✅ ❌ Manage offline devices ✅ ❌ Add items to the team library ✅ ❌ Access and use items from the team library ✅ ✅ Share surveys with others ✅ ✅ Access to all the paid features associated with the plan level of the team ✅ ✅ Permissions for Contributor Seats Contributor seats focus on one area of a survey—the survey design, collecting responses, or analyzing results. Team members need to share surveys with Analysts so they have surveys to analyze. Here's what Analysts can do with the team's shared surveys: Exports, shared data pages, and dashboards Unlimited rules and filters on surveys shared with you Analyst Analyze surveys ✅ Exports , shared data pages , and dashboards ✅ View and comment on survey design ✅ View collectors ✅ * View the team Library ❌ Own surveys ❌ Request phone support ❌ View Contributor seat features on the Plans and Pricing page (you'll see Full access seat features instead) ❌ Integrations and direct API access ❌ * This table shows what an Analyst can do if given the default access levels . Survey owners can edit permissions to prevent Analysts from accessing the Collect Responses section. TIP! If you're an Analyst and need additional permissions, contact your Primary Admin. Changing Someone's Seat or Role If you need to change someone's seat or role, choose an option below to learn more. Expand | Collapse Change seat To change someone's seat: Select My Team from the main navigation. Select Manage Users . Locate the person whose seat you want to update and choose View User Details . Next to the seat, select Change . Select the seat you want to assign—you can see how many Seats Available you currently have. If the seat has 0 available , Select Add Seats to purchase the seat. Select Save . An email notification is sent to the team member to let them know their new seat and role. Since Contributor seats can't own surveys, you may have to ask a Full Access seat to transfer or delete their surveys before you can change their seat to a Contributor seat. Change the Primary Admin If you can’t log into the Primary Admin account, contact support. The Primary Admin can edit their account details (name, email address, etc.) to the new person's. However, steps to complete this process depend on whether the new person is already on the team: Change to someone who isn't on the team yet To change the Primary Admin: Log into your Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Change the email address on your account to the email address of the person you want to be the new Primary Admin. Change to someone who is on the team Changing the Primary Admin to someone else that's already part of your team is a multi-step process, so we'll start with an example. EXAMPLE In this example, Cindy and Deanna are already part of the same team. Cindy is the Primary Admin, and Deanna is a Full User. Cindy wants to make Deanna the new Primary Admin instead. Here's what needs to happen: 1. Deanna transfers all of her surveys to Cindy's Primary Admin account. 2. Cindy deletes Deanna's Full User account from the team. 3. Cindy changes the email address on her own account to Deanna's email address. 4. Deanna is now the Primary Admin and Cindy is no longer in the team. If you're the current Primary Admin, follow these steps to switch the Primary Admin to someone else that's already on your team: Before you do anything, ask the other person to log in to their account and transfer their surveys to the current Primary Admin account. Log in to the Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Select My Team from the main navigation. Select Manage Users . Find the person who you want to be the new Primary Admin. If their email address is linked to multiple SurveyMonkey accounts, you will need to contact support or choose different email address for the Primary Admin account. Delete their account from the team . Change the email address on your account to the email address of the new person. If the original Primary Admin still needs to be in the team, the new Primary Admin can invite them to fill the open seat at no additional cost. If you change the email address on your account to someone else, you'll lose access to the account and all surveys and data within it. You won't be a part of the team anymore unless the new Primary Admin invites you to join the team.

To export the report as a CSV, click Export in the upper-right corner of the table. At this time there's no way to export an individual user's survey list. Timestamp Format Timestamps are shown in ISO 8601 format, which looks like this: 2016-02-17T21:37:40.643Z The first portion is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. The second portion (introduced by the letter T) is the time in 24-hour notation (HH:mm:ss.sss). The letter Z at the end of the timestamp stands for the ""Zulu"" time zone, which is the same as UTC. Setting up Display Columns You can choose which columns to display by using Table setup in the upper-right corner of the table. Email is the first column in the User Report, with a dropdown list of all other columns to select and view, or unselect to hide. Setting the Date Range By default, the report shows your current billing cycle. You can narrow down the time period by using the date dropdown menu above the table. Date filters affect the Active surveys, Response and Shared surveys columns only. The following date ranges are available: Current billing cycle (default) Today This week This month This quarter This year Last 365 days TIP! All date ranges end with the current date . If you can’t select a date, no data is available for that time period. You can’t select dates before June 2023, as this was when the User Report feature was first introduced. Viewing Surveys in an Account In the User Report, you can see the surveys created by people on your team and help manage those surveys. You can easily transfer a survey from one account to another , share surveys on behalf of others, or delete surveys . For more information on survey management, see Manage your Team's Surveys. Deleting a survey is a permanent action that can't be reversed. To keep a survey and its responses available for the Team, make sure to transfer the survey to another before deleting. To view a list of surveys in a specific account: Go to the User Report page. Click on the Email address of the user whose surveys you'd like to see. When you view someone’s surveys, you can see how many surveys the user has created, shared, and has open collectors for. TIP! To preview a survey, click any survey title to preview the entire survey—responses won't be recorded. Searching for a survey When you're viewing an individual user's survey list, you can use the search bar in the upper-right corner of the table to quickly find a specific survey in their account. The search bar will search the Survey Title only—not the contents of the survey.

Multilingual Surveys,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/manage/multilingual-surveys/,"Multilingual Surveys | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview How it Works Adding a Language & Downloading the Translation File Translating Files Uploading Translations to SurveyMonkey Managing Translations Sending a Multilingual Survey Analyzing a Multilingual Survey Help Managing & Sharing Surveys Survey Options Multilingual Surveys SurveyMonkey Multilingual Surveys Video Overview How it Works Adding a Language & Downloading the Translation File Translating Files Uploading Translations to SurveyMonkey Managing Translations Sending a Multilingual Survey Analyzing a Multilingual Survey Multilingual Surveys Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free You can create a multilingual survey with different language options by adding your own translations. With a single survey, your respondents can take the survey in the language they’re most comfortable with. You can also send a web link or email invitation (in Beta) that automatically opens your survey to the selected language. Video Overview How It Works Depending on how you send your survey, you can let respondents choose their preferred language from a dropdown menu on the survey, or send a special web link or email invitation that opens the survey in a specific language. Someone’s language browser settings may effect the survey language displayed to them. Continue with the instructions below to set it up. Adding a Language & Downloading the Translation File Once you add a language to your survey, you can download the file and start working on your translations. These files are unique to each survey. If you make changes to the survey design or make a copy of a survey , you will need to make a new translation file. Your translation file includes text from the Design Survey and Collect Responses sections of your survey. Finalize all your text and settings in both places before adding another language to your survey. This helps keep your default language and your translations consistent. To add a survey language: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. In the left sidebar, click Options . Click Language . Choose the default survey language from the dropdown—this is the language you'll base the other translations on. Click + Language to open the Survey Languages window. Click + Language . Select a language from the dropdown menu. Click Add . Click Download to download the translation file to your computer. Click Done . Dialects & Locales Some languages have different dialects based on country or region. For these languages, you can click the + Locale option and choose the specific dialect or locale you'd like to provide translations for. Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian text automatically displays in RTL orientation. We don't support other languages in RTL orientation. Translating Files Choose whether to use a CSV file or PO file. Translating the CSV File Your downloaded .csv file may have pre-populated translations for default text in the Translated_Text (Modify this column only) column—you can choose to edit this text. Leave all other columns unchanged including Original Text , which is your survey text in the default language. If you’re having issues with Excel or another spreadsheet program, try Google Spreadsheets. Download and save your file as Comma-Separated Values (.csv, current sheet). To properly edit and translate your .csv file, follow the steps below. Errors may occur if you open or double-click the downloaded translation file from SurveyMonkey—you need to import it correctly to your spreadsheet. Expand | Collapse CSV Translation Steps using Google Sheets Do not open the translation file that’s downloaded from SurveyMonkey to your computer. If you do open it, delete it and download the file from SurveyMonkey again before continuing to the following steps. To add translations via a .csv file using Google Sheets: Select one or more .csv files to download and save to your computer. Don’t open or double-click the downloaded file. Open a new Google Sheets sheet. Click File and select Import . Upload the .csv file from your computer. Choose your separator type as Comma , select Replace current sheet , and uncheck Convert text to numbers . Click Import Data . Add your translations to the Translated_Text (Modify this column only) column. Don’t make edits to any other columns. To save the file, click File , select Download , and select Comma Separated Values . CSV Translation Steps for Mac Users using Excel To add translations via a .csv file on a Mac using Excel: Select one or more .csv files to download and save to your computer. Don’t open or double-click the downloaded file. It may contain special characters and accents which won’t display correctly. Open a blank Excel spreadsheet. Click Data > Get Data > From Text . Import your downloaded .csv file and click Get Data . From the import screen, click Delimited and select Unicode UTF-8 from the File Origin dropdown. Click Next . Click Comma under the Delimiters list. Remove all the other options. Click Next . Keep the Column Data Format as General . Click Finish . Under the Import Data modal, keep Existing sheet: =$A$1 selected. Click Ok . Add your translations to the Translated_Text (Modify this column only) column and don’t edit any other columns. Save the file as CSV UTF-8 . TIP! If you’re outside of the U.S., your computer preferences may be set to another region and cause Excel to use semicolons to separate text. To upload your files into SurveyMonkey, your Excel settings must use commas to separate text. CSV Translation Steps for Windows PC Users using Excel To add translations via a .csv file on a Windows PC using Excel: Select one or more .csv files to download and save to your computer. Don’t open or double-click the downloaded file. It may contain special characters and accents which won’t display correctly. Open a blank Excel spreadsheet. Click Data > From Text/CSV . Import your downloaded .csv file and click Import . From the import screen, select Unicode UTF-8 from the File Origin dropdown and Comma from the Delimiter dropdown. Click Load . Add your translations to the Translated_Text (Modify this column only) column and don’t edit any other columns. Save the file as CSV UTF-8 . TIP! If you’re outside of the U.S., your computer preferences may be set to another region and cause Excel to use semicolons to separate text. To upload your files into SurveyMonkey, your Excel settings must use commas to separate text. Translating the PO File The other translation file is a PO format (with .po file extension), which is often used in specialized translation software to maintain translations on multilingual websites. We recommend using translation software like Transifex or Poedit to translate the PO file in a more user-friendly interface. From there you can export the translated PO file, and upload it back into SurveyMonkey. You can also use your computer's text editor like Notepad on a PC or TextEdit on a Mac to open and edit the file. When you open the PO file in a text editor, you'll see a lot of code—but don't worry! You don't need to know how to code in order to translate the file. You only need to focus on two parts: Keyword Description msgid Your survey text, in the default language. msgtr The translation. You'll see msgid and msgstr repeated throughout the file for every piece of text that appears in your survey. How to add your translations to the PO file To add your translations to the file: For each piece of survey text (msgid) in the file, check the translation (msgstr) that immediately follows it: If the double quotes are empty, it means that you'll need to provide your own translation for that text in between the double quotes. If the double quotes have a translation already, it means we've done some of the work for you! We pre-populate the file with some translations, but you can still edit the text if needed. When you're done adding all your translations, save the file. Examples Here are a few excerpts from a PO file where the default survey language is English, and you're translating it to Spanish. These examples should help you understand how to read the PO file, and how to add your translations in the right place. Expand | Collapse Prepopulated Translations In this excerpt of the PO file, the text is already translated. You can tell because the double quotes next to each msgstr are already filled in with translated text ( bolded below). In this case, you could either keep the default translations, or edit them however you'd like. msgctxt ""{""checksum"": 3764012647, ""cxt"": ""survey_next"", ""id"": 120907390}"" msgid ""Next"" msgstr "" Próxima "" msgctxt ""{""checksum"": 3722898670, ""cxt"": ""survey_done"", ""id"": 121029320}"" msgid ""Done"" msgstr "" Listo "" Check out Changing the Survey Language to get an idea of what kind of text we provide default translations for. Untranslated Text In this excerpt of the PO file, the text is untranslated. You can tell because the double quotes next to each msgstr are empty. You can enter your own translations by adding the translated text in between the double quotes. msgctxt ""{""cxt"": ""question_heading"", ""id"": 153369978}"" msgid ""Which planet is closest to the Sun?"" msgstr """" msgctxt ""{""cxt"": ""question_option_text"", ""id"": 1112152313}"" msgid ""Venus"" msgstr """" msgctxt ""{""cxt"": ""question_option_text"", ""id"": 1112152314}"" msgid ""Mercury"" msgstr """" msgctxt ""{""cxt"": ""question_option_text"", ""id"": 1112152315}"" msgid ""Mars"" msgstr """" msgctxt ""{""cxt"": ""question_option_text"", ""id"": 1112152316}"" msgid ""Earth"" msgstr """" Adding Your Translations The text bolded below shows where you'd enter your own translations—in between the double quotes. msgctxt ""{""cxt"": ""question_heading"", ""id"": 153369978}"" msgid ""Which planet is closest to the Sun?"" msgstr "" ¿Qué planeta está más cerca del sol?

The language is automatically enabled and ready to go, but you can click the toggle to disable the language if you want to wait before making it live. Check to make sure that the file is 100% translated. If it says anything less than 100%, you're missing translations for some of your survey text. Adding Missing Translations To add missing translations: Click download to download the current translation file. Translate the remaining text in the file. Save the file. Go back to the Design Survey section in SurveyMonkey and click Options > Language > Edit Languages . Click Replace file . Upload the updated file. Managing Translations Learn how to manage existing languages and translations you've added to your survey. Expand | Collapse Replacing or Updating Translations To update or replace an existing translation: In the Design Survey section, click Options > Language > Edit Languages . Download the current translation file. Update the translations you want to change. Save the file. Go back to the Design Survey section in SurveyMonkey and click Options > Language > Edit Languages . Click Replace file . Upload the updated file. Disabling a Language Disabling a language will hide it from people taking your survey, but you'll be able to enable it again at any time. To disable a language: In the Design Survey section, click Options > Language > Edit Languages . Click the toggle to the right of the language you want to disable. You can enable the language again by turning the toggle back on. Deleting a Language Deleting a language removes all translations in that language. New people won't be able to take the survey in that language, but any responses you received in that language so far won't be affected—they'll remain in your results. To delete a language: In the Design Survey section, click Options > Language > Edit Languages . Click the Trash can icon to the right of the language you want to delete. Changing the Default Language Changing the default language changes the language that the survey will open by default. It also changes the source language that the other translations are based on. Changing the default language will delete all existing translations—you'll need to redownload the PO files and upload new translations. To change the default language: In the Design Survey section, click Options > Language > Edit Languages . Under Default Survey Language, click Change . Read the warning and click Continue . In the Options section, choose a new default language from the dropdown. Click + Language to start adding more languages. Sending a Multilingual Survey You can send a multilingual survey with any collector type , but we recommend either the Web Link collector or Email Invitation collector (in Beta) because you can send people directly to a specific language version of your survey. If you send your multilingual survey using a different collector type, there may be elements that you can't translate. Your survey is sent in the default language, but respondents can choose their preferred language from the dropdown. Sending a Web Link You can send people directly to a specific language version of your survey by using language web links. A language link will open the survey with the specified language automatically selected, so people taking your survey don't need to select their preferred language from the dropdown themselves. This is a great option if you plan on sending your survey to different language cohorts separately. The base URL of each language link is the same as the main survey link, so using language links doesn't create separate collectors. All your responses will still be associated with the same collector. To get a language link: Create a new Web Link . Under the main survey link, expand the Language Links section. Click Copy next to a language link to copy it to your clipboard. Share it anywhere! Sending an Email Invitation Beta feature: Sending a multilingual survey by email invitation is only available to some customers at this time. You can send customized email invitations in multiple languages . Analyzing a Multilingual Survey When you analyze your results, all the responses across languages are merged together as one single data set. Throughout your results, the question text and answer choices will show in the default survey language, but they represent all responses to your survey—regardless of what language the respondent selected. When you export responses, the question and answer text are in your default survey language. If you want to see responses based on what language people took the survey in, you can filter by language . To see which language each respondent used to take the survey view the Individual Responses section, or export All Responses Data in XLS or SPSS format.

Automated Emails with Salesforce,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-automated-emails/,"Automated Emails with Salesforce | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Video Before You Start Building Your Email Template Scheduling Reminder Emails Viewing the Outbound Message in Salesforce Setting Up Your Salesforce Workflow Sending Emails From Custom Domains Help Salesforce Sending Emails from Salesforce Automated Emails with Salesforce GetFeedback Automated Emails with Salesforce Video Before You Start Building Your Email Template Scheduling Reminder Emails Viewing the Outbound Message in Salesforce Setting Up Your Salesforce Workflow Sending Emails From Custom Domains Easily create and schedule email surveys using Salesforce Automation. Our Salesforce Automation gives you access to advanced tracking and analytics, helps you avoid using up your Salesforce email send limits, and lets you set reminder emails without setting up complicated apex triggers in Salesforce. Salesforce started blocking new workflow rules in 2023. Learn more Video Before You Start Make sure that your Salesforce environment has Modify Metadata and Customize Application permissions enabled. Before automating emails, connect your survey to Salesforce. From the survey builder, go to Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings to connect the survey to your integrated Salesforce environment. If you use a survey question as your email call to action, remove the title page of the survey. In the survey builder, hover over the title page and select X to remove the page. Then, publish your survey again. Build your automation in the Live version of your survey. When you publish your survey, any Draft settings will be erased and can’t be recovered. Your Draft settings won't be published to the Live email. Building Your Email Template From your survey, go to Distribute > Email > Salesforce Automation to build your email template. Email Details Choose your Call to action . Embed a button or embed a survey question directly in your email. If you choose a survey question, we recommend using the first question. If you use a later question, the survey still opens in the browser on the first question. Enter an email Subject line that’s clear and concise. Enter your Sender name . This is the name that displays in the From field on the email. Select your Sender email . This includes two parts: Your company, brand, or account name . This should be anything that’s easily recognizable to your customers, such as the name of your company or “support.” Learn more about complying with spam policies Your email domain . You can select one of our default domains or your own custom domain. If you use the default address, the reply-to address will be your GetFeedback login email, and people may be able to see and reply to your personal address. If you use a custom email domain, you can use the Sender email as the reply-to address. Select your custom domain, then check the box to set your custom email address as the reply-to address. Learn how to request a custom domain Don't use accented characters (such as é or á) in the account name. Special characters will cause the email to fail. Don’t add the email domain to the account name (such as @getfeedback.com). You’ll select the domain after entering a name. If you add the domain to the name, your email will fail. To end your survey after a certain number of days, select an option from the dropdown under Each survey remains active for . After the selected number of days passes, your survey stops collecting responses. Salesforce Data Set up the Salesforce triggers and fields for the email. Object that triggers your email alert : Select the Salesforce object that triggers your email outbound message from Salesforce. This should be the same object that your Salesforce flow is based on (If you don’t know this yet, create your workflow in Salesforce and come back to finish your survey template later on). Recipient name : Select the Salesforce field to pull the customer’s name address from. Recipient email : Select the Salesforce field to pull the customer’s email address from. If one isn’t available, select a different object, or add an email field to the object you’ve selected in Salesforce. Formula fields in Salesforce are not supported on outbound messages. Map Unsubscribes and Bounces to Salesforce Set up checkbox fields in Salesforce for hard bounces and unsubscribe requests before mapping them from GetFeedback. When your email bounces or a customer unsubscribes, you can map requests and bounces back to Salesforce so you can build suppression list reporting or curate a high-performing distribution list for future emails. To map hard bounces and unsubscribe requests to Salesforce: Turn on the Suppression list sync toggle. Choose the Salesforce fields to map hard bounces and unsubscribe requests to. If someone unsubscribes, or an email is returned as a hard bounce, we’ll update the Unsubscribed and Hard Bounce checkboxes on the Salesforce contact. To resubscribe an address to your GetFeedback emails, contact us . Adding Merge Fields When you select the Salesforce trigger object, we add certain merge fields by default. If you want to track and record additional information, you can add more merge fields to the email. For example, if you want to reference any lookup relationships in Salesforce, add those object IDs as merge fields. To add merge fields: Scroll to the Additional merge fields section, then select + Merge Field . Enter the Merge Field Name (the title of the merge field) and Merge Field Value (the name of the Salesforce field to pull data from). Designing Your Email Edit the logo, greeting, and body message of your email. Add a logo : Select Add a logo , then upload an image. Add a greeting : Select Add an optional greeting and enter your greeting text. Add a message : Select Add an optional message and enter your message text. Personalizing Your Email To personalize your email with merge fields, select the subject, greeting, or message fields, then select Personalize . You can choose from any merge fields you’ve added to your email. You can also add a fallback term to use if we can't pull a recipient's information from Salesforce. Saving Your Email When you’ve finished building your template, select Save changes in the bottom right corner. Scheduling Reminder Emails You can send up to 2 reminder messages to your recipients to encourage them to take your survey. Select the First reminder tab to start setting up reminder emails. Learn more about Salesforce reminder emails Viewing the Outbound Message in Salesforce In the top left corner of the email editor, select View in Salesforce to open the outbound message in Salesforce. Setting Up Your Salesforce Flow If you haven’t already, set up a flow in Salesforce to trigger your survey outbound message. You can either: Let GetFeedback automatically create a case closed flow Create a custom Flow in Salesforce Using a Case Closed Flow Salesforce started blocking new workflow rules in 2023. Learn more If you choose Case as the object that triggers your email, GetFeedback can automatically create a case closed flow for you in Salesforce. The case closed flow triggers the email to send after a customer’s case has been closed. In the Initial invitation tab, scroll to the Salesforce data section. Under the Object that triggers your email alert field, turn on the Create case closed flow toggle. When you save your changes in the email builder, we create the flow and connect it to your outbound message in Salesforce. Make sure to save your email again after turning on the toggle. You can edit this case closed workflow in Salesforce, to set time delay or other settings as needed. For workflows and automated emails that aren’t triggered by a Case object, follow the instructions below to create the workflow directly in Salesforce. Creating a Custom Salesforce Flow Create a flow in Salesforce to trigger your survey outbound message. When you’re done creating your flow, make sure to test it. Enable your outbound message and flow to make sure everything is working as expected before going live. Sending Emails From Custom Domains You can set up a custom email domain (such as support@yourcompany.com ) or create a custom subdomain (such as support@yourcompany.getfeedback.com ). Using a custom domain requires changes to your DNS. Using Your Own Email Domain When setting up automated emails from Salesforce, you can send using your own email domain by setting up DKIM. DKIM adds a unique signature to the message header for each email you send. This signature is specific for your domain and is generated by a private key. The corresponding public key is added to a DNS record for your domain. We’ll provide you with this key so that you can add this to your DNS records before sending with us. DKIM then permits receiving email systems to verify that the email was authorized to be sent. Using DKIM can help with your deliverability rates, ensuring that more surveys reach more of your audience for better response rates and data overall. Learn how to request a custom domain . Using a Custom Subdomain If you don't want to change your DNS, you can also send using a custom GetFeedback subdomain. Contact us to set up a GetFeedback subdomain. Your subdomain will look like yourcompany.getfeedback.com .

Installing on Websites,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/web-implementation/,"Installing on Websites | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Passive Feedback: Web Feedback Buttons Installing GetFeedback with a Tag Management System Active Feedback: Web Campaigns (Popup Surveys) Integrating GetFeedback with Your Data Layer Avoiding Common Pitfalls Validating Your Web Page Installing on Sites in a Closed Environment Troubleshooting Tools Help Survey channels Website Installing on Websites GetFeedback Installing on Websites Passive Feedback: Web Feedback Buttons Installing GetFeedback with a Tag Management System Active Feedback: Web Campaigns (Popup Surveys) Integrating GetFeedback with Your Data Layer Avoiding Common Pitfalls Validating Your Web Page Installing on Sites in a Closed Environment Troubleshooting Tools Install your web button to start collecting feedback on your site. This guide helps you get started installing your web button, creating active feedback campaigns, integrating with your data layer, and troubleshooting the implementation. Passive Feedback: Web Feedback Buttons Even if you don’t want to use the web button, you need to install it on your website. Active feedback campaigns won’t work if the web button isn’t installed. You can use our JavaScript API to hide the button on certain pages. Using GetFeedback, you’ll set up a feedback button so users can provide feedback on your website. This feedback button needs to be implemented once on your website. After this, you can manage the button right from your GetFeedback account. Your button will automatically be updated when you make changes. To get started with feedback buttons: Create your button . Install your button with a tag management system , or install it directly on your site . Review your first responses , or or create a workspace to analyze results across multiple surveys and campaigns. Set up automated emails or Slack notifications to get notified when someone takes your survey. Installing GetFeedback with a Tag Management System You can easily install your feedback button using a tag management system. Tag management systems let you control page load rules, use tags and triggering, and add other conditions. GetFeedback is compatible with any standard tag manager. Here are links to implementation instructions for common tag management systems: Google Tag Manager (GTM) Adobe Dynamic Tag Manager (DTM) Tealium Relay42 Commanders Act SAP Fiori App Installing GetFeedback Directly on Your Site If you're using multiple buttons (e.g. different sized buttons for mobile and desktop) on a responsive website, contact us for a code snippet that will show the correct button to your visitors based on their screen size or device. If you don’t use a tag management system, you can install your web button directly on your site. The snippet allows the GetFeedback code to run on your website using an <iframe>. To implement GetFeedback for Web on your website: In app.usabilla.com , select Setup under Buttons & Forms . Find your button, then select Show javascript code . Copy the JavaScript snippet. In your website's code, paste the JavaScript snippet after the opening <body> tag and before the closing </body> tag. Make sure you place the JavaScript as close as possible to the </body> on every page of your website. Your button will now be displayed on every page where you added the code. If you don't wish to show your button yet, turn it OFF in Setup. If your website uses a Content Security Policy (CSP), you’ll need to add a hash to your website’s script-src. To find this hash, go to Setup. Find your feedback button. Then, select Options > Installation . Copy the hash below your button code and add it to your site. Active Feedback: Web Campaigns (Popup Surveys) Once you install your web button, you can use campaigns. Web campaigns allow you to actively target surveys to a specific group of visitors on your website. To get started with web campaigns: Pick the type of campaign you want to run. Create a campaign . Set your campaign targeting and scheduling . For single-page applications (SPA), implement virtual pageviews so you can target visitors on your site. Analyze individual campaign results , or create a workspace to analyze results across multiple surveys and campaigns. Integrating GetFeedback with Your Data Layer You can push data from your web button to your data layer. This allows you to send data to third-party tools, such as Google Analytics, or bring data from your data layer into GetFeedback. Learn more Avoiding Common Pitfalls When implementing GetFeedback for Web, keep the following in mind: Load the GetFeedback code just before the closing tag. Make sure your site resources, like the CSS and images, are available for the GetFeedback server. Don’t load any additional content after the GetFeedback button has loaded. Make sure your page markup is valid. Make sure the content on your page doesn’t have a z-index that exceeds the z-index of the GetFeedback button container. Validating Your Web Page When a user leaves feedback on your page using the GetFeedback feedback button a screenshot will be created that’ll be attached to the feedback item. This screenshot is generated by using the HTML of your page. You must verify that your site code is valid to make sure your screenshots generate correctly. You can also modify or stop generating screenshots, if needed. Learn more You can do a markup validation by using the Markup Validation Service of W3C. Common issues that could cause errors are: Not having a DOCTYPE declared. Not having the Character Encoding declared. Having invalid characters in your tags (i.e., a semicolon(;) instead of a comma (,) in your meta tag). Markup validation is the process of checking a Web document against the grammar (generally a DTD) it claims to be using. Web pages are written in a markup language (e.g. HTML). Markup language must comply with certain rules. You can check this compliance by doing markup validation. Installing on Sites in a Closed Environment Pages on local servers, or servers in a closed environment, may cause issues with your web feedback button. GetFeedback won’t work when your page uses files that are located within the same computer, such as a page using the File URI scheme. The GetFeedback code mirrors the scheme and protocol that is used for the page it’s installed on. On locally-hosted pages (for example, on a staging environment or an intranet website), the screenshot feature doesn’t work correctly. In most cases, our server isn’t able to access the resources needed to create the screenshots. To resolve this issue, you can either: Use resources that are publicly available for both your web page and the GetFeedback server. Allowlist the GetFeedback server’s IP address. Learn more about allow list information Troubleshooting Tools In some cases, you’ll want to combine GetFeedback with other software, like Google Tag Manager, to get the most out of your customer feedback. Below is a list of common tools that may be helpful when troubleshooting or testing your GetFeedback implementation: EditThisCookie (Chrome plugin) Web Developer (Chrome plugin) DataLayer Inspector (Chrome plugin) Custom JavaScript for website (Chrome plugin) Firebugz (Firefox Plugin) Google Tag Assistant (Chrome plugin) Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

How to Search for Applications,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/app-search/,"How to Search for Applications | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Site Search Tool Manage Applications Search Tool Help Monitor Filtering and Searching How to Search for Applications Apply How to Search for Applications Site Search Tool Manage Applications Search Tool As an administrator, a key responsibility is to manage, monitor, and report on the applications collected within your site. This article discusses the various ways to search for applications within your site to perform these actions. Site Search Tool Locating applications is quick and easy using the site search tool located at the top of the page in the administrator role. This search tool allows administrators to search by the title of the application or the name of the user to view all relevant results without having to navigate away from the current page. The results displayed using this tool can be retrieved from any program within your site. For results that are specific to a particular program, the Manage Applications Search Tool may be more effective. To search for an application: Select the Site Search icon. Type in the application title, reference ID, or name of the owner of the application. Select the application from the results within the window to access the application. Once an application result is selected, the user will be redirected to the administrator view of the application . Manage Applications Search Tool Alternatively, administrators can search for applications belonging to a single program within the program's Manage Applications page. This search tool will display all applications that are relevant to the search terms used by the administrator. The results displayed can be narrowed down by using complete and specific search terms relevant to the application or applications the user is searching for. To search for an application within Manage Applications: Go to Manage Applications . Place your cursor in the search field located directly under the Custom Filter menu. Insert the application's title, the reference ID, or the user's name and hit the Search icon. Narrow down the search terms further if too many results are retrieved. Enter the application by selecting the ID of the application or perform the action required using the actions at the top of the table. TIP! If the application you are searching for is not appearing as a result, it may be that a filter is currently applied to prevent the application from being displayed. Try clearing active filters and ensuring the application status (active, archived, trashed) filter is correctly applied and try searching for the application again.

How to Embed To embed a question in an email: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Add a supported question type to the very beginning of page 1. Make sure your survey meets the design requirements . Don't enable any option that would disqualify the question or you won't see the option to embed the first question. Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Create an Email Invitation . Compose your message and make sure the Embed first question toggle is on. (Optional) Customize your message . Click Next . Select the In-email Response Capture collector optio n and other collector options. In-email Response Capture Collector Option You can choose whether to save the first response from the email instantly or to wait to save the response until the respondent clicks the Next or Done button. By default, the collector option is set to Off and saves the first response upon clicking Next or Done. If the embedded question has an Other Textbox or Comment field , recipient’s responses won’t be recorded from the email instantly—the response is only submitted when clicking the Next or Done button in the browser. Password Protection isn't available when In-email Response Capture is On. To use Password protection, turn off In-email Response Capture. When In-email response capture is On, email scanner bots could click the links within your email invitation, as a security measure. These bot clicks record responses to the embedded question before your respondent sees the email. This means bots can cause misleading responses for the embedded question (including, a sole bot response, multiple responses, or varying NPS responses). When an actual respondent takes the survey, the responses recorded by email scanner bots are replaced by the respondent’s true answer. If you’re concerned about poor response quality due to email scanner bots, don’t enable In-email response capture. If you’ve already collected data with this option on, you can clean up your responses in Analyze by identifying and deleting incomplete responses related to the collector that were recorded shortly after sending the invitation. Bot answers will only have recorded responses to the embedded, first question. Survey Behavior How the first answer choice is saved is dependent on the In-email Response Capture collector option selection and whether the embedded question has an Other Textbox or Comment field. Regardless of whether the first answer is saved immediately or not, the survey taker is sent to the first page of the survey so they can continue answering the rest of the questions. They'll see their response to the first question pre-selected in SurveyMonkey. Survey takers need to click Next on the first page to save their other responses and trigger any logic in your survey. If you're sending a test email to preview the survey, we don't pre-populate the response in the survey preview since we don't actually collect any responses in survey previews . When the first question is embedded, the email invitation doesn't have a Begin Survey button. Survey takers need to answer the embedded question to open the survey in a browser tab to take remaining survey questions. Supported Question Types To embed a question in an email invitation, use a supported question type as the first question on page 1 of your survey: Multiple Choice Net Promoter® Score (NPS) Star Rating Survey Design Requirements To embed a question in an email invitation, your survey needs to meet these survey design requirements: Use a supported question type as the first question on page 1 of your survey—don't add anything in front of the question, like an Intro Page or Text. Don't use Page Randomization or Block Randomization on page 1 of your survey. Don't enable a Quota on your survey. Setting and Option Requirements The settings and options applied to the question you want to embed may disqualify it or cause it to render differently in the email than what you see in your survey design. Expand | Collapse Multiple Choice Questions Don't insert an image or video in answer choices. If you enable the Randomize, Flip, or Sort Choices option on the question, don't randomize or flip answer choices, but you can alphabetize them. Don't enable the Adjust Question Layout option. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. We don't recommend adding an “Other” answer option or comment field on the question you want to embed—the question will render differently in the email. While the full Other answer option or comment field will display once the survey opens in a browser, survey-takers may not notice the additional answer option. If you changed the layout of the question to 2 columns, 3 columns, or horizontal, it'll be displayed as 1 column in the email. Star Rating Questions You can use the Star, Smiley, or Heart icons on the question you want to embed, but, due to email client compatibility, you can't use the Thumb icon. Don't add Other as an answer option for comments. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. Don't use image or video rating labels . You can choose a scale from 2 to 10, however, questions with larger scales aren't mobile responsive—they'll be static in the email, so people will have to scroll to see the full scale. Troubleshooting Issues Why does the email look different than what I see in SurveyMonkey? If you update your survey design after scheduling your message and it no longer meets the requirements, we'll send the default email template without the embedded question. Email clients can render HTML messages differently , which can cause HTML Template or Custom HTML messages to display differently than what you expect.

You can add custom variables to your surveys to track specific data about your respondents, such as their subscription type, previous page, and more. Custom variables are pieces of data that you can include when someone leaves feedback through a button or campaign . They can derive from other 3rd party tools or from your own website. Custom variables are used to add extra information about your respondents or the website, email, or mobile app respondents left feedback about. Connecting feedback to data from other sources helps you to: Add context to your feedback Quantify your feedback Use feedback to understand your quantitative data You can also use custom variables to accurately target people with your survey. For example, you can use custom variables to survey people between 25 and 40 years old and have purchased a specific product in the past. You can add custom variables to web, app, and email widget forms. However, the implementation, display, and analysis options differ for each form type. Custom Variable Structure Custom variables are structured in key-value pairs. The variable key is the name of the variable and is matched with a value. The following list shows examples of custom variable structures: Subscription: Enterprise Tier: Gold Current_shopping_basket_value: €49.95 Previous page: https://www.google.com Once implemented, custom variables will be available in app.usabilla.com for each feedback item to which they were added. GetFeedback only stores custom variables when someone submits a response. A maximum of 488 characters can be included in a custom variable for both the feedback button and campaigns. Custom variables allow you to enrich your feedback with data from other sources by passing these on data along with the feedback item. This means that you can add extra information such as usernames, customer types or A/B test variables to your feedback. Having these data in the same place as your feedback, will help you to connect the dots and analyze your feedback quicker and more extensively. Best Practices for Data and Custom Variables Custom variables can include any sort of data, provided that: You already collected these data The data is available for GetFeedback Your company's privacy policies allow you to send this data to GetFeedback It’s best to only send data to GetFeedback if you are actually planning to use it. This will help you to keep your feedback clean and help you meet data privacy requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) . If you want to add data which could potentially be used to identify individuals (e.g. user IDs or usernames), consider including a hashed or encrypted version of the data. You will be able to recognize the user that left feedback, but no one outside your organization will be able to do so. To help you analyze data later, it’s best to keep the custom variables short and comprehensive. Keep in mind that custom variables can be used to filter and categorize your feedback. Advanced Usage You can also use custom variables for more specific use cases. Some examples of advanced usage are listed below: Connecting GetFeedback and your data layer . Creating a survey for respondents that come from a specific page. Collect feedback on your Zendesk customer support emails and connect it directly to the support agent in question. Target App Campaigns to Custom Variables Custom variables add extra information about your respondent or the application. You can also use them to target a specific group of visitors with your app campaign . You can target based on multiple custom variables at the same time. These work based on AND logic, so all custom variables have to match to trigger the campaign. For example, you could target the following custom variables: user ID email address subscription type shopping cart value whether the user is logged in or not To use custom variables to target your app campaign: Define the variables in the campaign editor. Make sure the variables are sent form your application to our SDK. You can find the method you need to use for this in our iOS and Android documentation. Learn more about creating app campaigns Using Custom Variables in Web Buttons and Campaigns Add custom variables to web feedback buttons and campaigns to collect specific data with feedback items and campaign results. Define the data you want to pass to GetFeedback Examples of Custom Variables are user names, session IDs, A/B-testing variables from other tools, demographic data, and membership statuses. Include the variables with a JavaScript API call The following JavaScript API call can be included on every page on which you would like to include Custom Variables. Please ensure the call is installed on every page below the GetFeedback Digital code. View raw code here. In this example, Username and SessionID are the custom variable names that will appear in GetFeedback, while the values indicate a reference to the variable. The API call can be used multiple times. Any call replaces the data of the previous call. The last call’s data will be used when the feedback process is started. Append and Update Custom Variables To make it easier to update custom variables, use a JavaScript Object to store the custom variables. If you update the object and resend the custom variables using the JavaScript object, you can easily keep custom variables up to date or even append values. The code sample below shows how you might accomplish this. View raw code here. Salesforce and Custom Variables If you use our Salesforce integration and want to push custom variables into your Salesforce environment, you will need to use one of the predefined custom variable field names instead of defining your own. There are a total of 5 predefined field names for variables in the Salesforce app. Learn more Example : You want to send the Username and Session ID variables to Salesforce. To make these variables available in Salesforce, your code should use one the predefined variable field names like this: View raw code here. Allowed Values for Custom Variables When you use our JavaScript API call to send custom variables to GetFeedback, you can pass on the following 2 objects: email : The respondent’s email address. If your button asks respondents for their email address, the field will be pre-filled with the data you set here. Otherwise, the email address will be sent as is. custom : A JavaScript object containing custom data. The data types listed below can be used in custom variables. Boolean Integer Float Double String (up to 500 characters) Array NULL Object Arrays and objects can have a maximum depth of 2 and must consist of uniform values (only strings, only integers etc.). TIP! It’s best to avoid using objects or arrays. Using only uniform values allows you to easily compare and export feedback and campaign results. The custom variables will now be included in every feedback item and campaign result. Also, you can use the custom variables to target campaigns to specific visitors. Targeting Campaigns Based on Custom Variables Once you set up your custom variables, you can target campaigns based on the custom variables. For example, if your users have individual profiles on your website, you can set a campaign to trigger based on profile variables such as age, gender, or membership status. To target custom variables in a campaign: If you haven’t already, set up custom variables on each page you’re displaying your campaign. Create or edit your campaign . Once you reach the User Targeting step, choose to Show your campaign to certain visitors . Toggle on the option to use a Custom JavaScript Value Trigger . Add any variables you want that match the ones that are being called by the JavaScript already on the webpage. Once you've set your targeting options, save the campaign and connect it to the page's button. Your campaign will now show when these conditions are met. Adding Custom Variables to Full Screen Survey Campaigns You can add your own custom variables to full survey campaign links. These custom variables can be whatever you want them to be. For example, you can specify the campaign you’ve added the variable to. To add custom variables to your full screen campaign: Copy the URL for your full screen campaign of your choice. Example : http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/51fa4e6706a1ea6b73000001 Add to this URL the variables you would like to collect, as specified in the example below. Example : http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/51fa4e6706a1ea6b73000001 ?source=twitter To add multiple custom variables, add an & between the variables. Example: View raw code here. Once a respondent completes the survey, the variables are stored in an extra column in the campaign results . Targeting Visitors Based on Previous Page Use the document.referrer custom variable to target visitors based on their previous page. This targeting option can be useful in many ways, as shown in the examples below: If someone is in the booking flow but navigates to another section of the website, you can ask why they left the booking flow, provide help, or offer a discount promotion code. If someone visits a certain page, then heads directly to the FAQ or Help Desk Page, you can ask if any information is missing on the page or ask why they visited the FAQ page. If your user takes an alternative journey, you can notify them with a Recruit Participants campaign and help redirect them to the right path. The document.referrer only works for multi-page websites, so it doesn’t work for single page applications . Check with your Customer Success Manager to confirm your website doesn’t block this functionality. Setting Up the document.referrer Variable Add document.referrer to your web pages as a custom variable using JavaScript. The code sample below shows how to add the variable to your page. Make sure to initialize the JavaScript after the feedback button has been loaded. View raw code here. Targeting the document.referrer Variable To target the document.referrer variable in a campaign: Create or edit your campaign . On the User targeting page, select Show your survey to certain visitors . Decide which page to display the campaign on. Turn on the toggle for Visitors on a particular page and add this page's URL as a target URL. Decide the page you want your visitor to come from (the previous page the visitor was on). This information is stored in the document.referrer variable. Turn on the toggle for Custom javascript value trigger . Enter the custom variable: For Variable , enter referrer . Set the condition for the rule (example: is equal to or contains). For Value , enter the URL or path of the page you want the visitor to come from (example: /products/). Select Next to schedule and save your campaign. Adding Custom Variables to In-Page Surveys By default, all feedback from In-Page widgets contain metadata to identify, sort, and manage your feedback. You can also collect additional information using custom variables. To use custom variables with in-page surveys: Under In-Page Widgets in the left-side menu, select Setup . Find the widget you want to add variables to, then select the Install icon. Check the box to Configure custom variables . As soon as you enable the custom variables, you can use them in your In-Page widgets. By default, we show 3 predefined custom variables: Category , Subcategory , and Item . You can use these custom variables to filter your feedback on the feedback page . To use a default custom variable, enter a value in one of the fields. For example, you could use Services in the Category field to track the category page you placed your in-page widget on. To create your own custom variable, manually enter the variable in the script using this format: ub-in-page-[variable name]=”[value]” For example, add ub-in-page-team=”marketing” In addition to the three predefined custom variables, you can also add more custom variables by manually editing the widget code on your page. Add an additional attribute to the widget code with a predefined prefix using the format below: View code block here. In this example, the variable would be named exampleName and the value would be exampleValue . Dynamically Add Custom Variables to In-Page Surveys Supplement feedback from your In-Page survey with information you already have about your respondents or your website. This information can be passed to GetFeedback through custom variables so every new In-Page feedback item will include your custom variables. To dynamically add custom variables to in-page surveys: Define the data you would like to pass on to GetFeedback . Examples of custom variables are: usernames, session IDs, A/B-testing variables from other tools, demographic data and membership statuses. Add an id attribute to your In-Page div element . Find the div element of In-Page on your website and add an id attribute to the div. This id will be used to append an attribute containing your custom variable to the div. Your div will then resemble the div below. View raw code here. Find the In-Page script on your page and add the below code. Place this code directly beneath the = In-Page script on your webpage. Replace in-page-id with the ID you’re using. Replace key with the name you would like to use in GetFeedback for your custom variable. Replace customVar with your custom variable. View raw code here. Test your custom variable . Leave feedback through your In-Page widget and check your variable in GetFeedback. You can filter feedback from in-page surveys using the custom variable, and the variable should be included in exports. Adding Custom Variables to Embedded Email Forms With app.usabilla.com , embedded email surveys can help you gather feedback on emails, such as newsletters or customer support emails. Add custom variables to email surveys to collect more info about the feedback, such as the newsletter version your respondents left feedback on or which support agent they worked with. To use custom variables in email surveys, your email client needs to support HTML in your email template (footer, signature, etc.). Static Custom Variables Static custom variables have a predefined name and value. For example, you may add a custom variable for surveys that members in the 'Silver' tier will see. The name of your custom variable would be 'Tier,' and the value would be Silver. Static custom variables are added to all feedback submitted through the form. Dynamic Custom Variables Dynamic custom variables only have a predefined name; the value may be different depending on the respondent. The value uses a placeholder that can be read by the email client you're using. When someone submits feedback through the form, the custom variable value will be whatever information is supplied through the placeholder. For example, you may send a newsletter to all of your members in different tiers. When members from the 'Gold' tier give feedback, the value of the Custom Variable will be 'Gold,' but when members from the 'Silver' tier give feedback, the value of the Custom Variable will be 'Silver'. To use dynamic custom variables, your email client needs to allow the use of variables as placeholders. Contact your email client if you need more information. Adding the Variables to Email To add custom variables to embedded email surveys: In app.usabilla.com , select Websites in the top left corner, then select Email . Select Setup . To create a new embedded email form, select Create new widget . Build your form as desired. To add variables to an existing form, find the form, then select Widget installation instructions . Copy the HTML code on the right of the screen. Paste the HTML into a text or code editor. The code consists of hyperlinks ( tags) and images ( tags). TIP : To make the code easier to read, save it as an .html file and run a Format or Beautify command. Add your custom variables to each link in your widget using this format: Example : A static custom variable may look like: &Tier=Silver - Tier , name of the variable, which you define. - Silver , value of the variable, which you define. A dynamic custom variable will look different based on the email provider you use. For example, in Frontapp, a dynamic custom variable may look like this: &Recipient={{recipient.email}} - Recipient , name of the variable, which you define. - {{recipient.email}} , value of the variable, which will be replaced with the recipient’s email address because the email client recognizes it. Salesforce and Custom Variables If you use our Salesforce integration and want to push custom variables into your Salesforce environment, you will need to use one of the predefined custom variable field names instead of defining your own. There are a total of 5 predefined field names for variables in the Salesforce app. Learn more Example : To make the recipient email variable available in Salesforce, your code should use one the pre-defined variable field names like this: &integration_sf_01={{recipient.email}} Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

How to Convert Values to a String (STR),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/convert-to-string/,"How to Convert Values to a String (STR) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the STR Function? Proper Formatting for STR Expressions Help Advanced Features How to Convert Values to a String (STR) Apply How to Convert Values to a String (STR) What is the STR Function? Proper Formatting for STR Expressions Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. This article will explain how to use the STR function to string together responses to a question in a list format. What is the STR Function? The STR function allows a single value to be converted into a string. If trying to use an STR function on text response fields, the string will be pulled as a list, separating the values of each text response with a comma (no spaces). If you are looking to use an STR function on a closed-ended question (i.e. Checkbox) the scores to the selected responses will be pulled as a list, separating the values of each choice with a comma (no spaces). TIP! If you wish to pull the choice labels of a closed-ended question into a list, consider In-Form Piping . Proper Formatting for STR Expressions The setup and formatting of the STR expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear.

Statistical Significance,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/significant-differences/,"Statistical Significance | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Viewing Statistical Significance What is a statistically significant difference? Calculating Statistical Significance Hiding Statistical Significance Help Analyzing Results Charts & Data Tables Statistical Significance SurveyMonkey Statistical Significance Viewing Statistical Significance What is a statistically significant difference? Calculating Statistical Significance Hiding Statistical Significance Statistical Significance Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free You can view if there's a statistically significant difference between how certain response groups answered the questions in your survey. To use the statistical significance feature in SurveyMonkey: Turn on statistical significance while adding a Compare Rule to a question in your survey. Choose the groups you want to compare to break down your survey results by group in a side-by-side comparison. Examine the data tables for the questions in your survey to see if there are statistically significant differences in how different groups answered the survey. Viewing Statistical Significance The following steps help you create a survey that can display statistical significance. Expand | Collapse Step 1: Add Closed-Ended Questions to a Survey To display statistical significance when analyzing results, you'll need to apply a Compare Rule to a question in your survey. You must use one of the following question types in your survey design to be able to apply a Compare Rule and calculate statistical significance: Multiple Choice Dropdown Matrix/Rating Scale Ranking Make sure your answer options break down into meaningful groups. The answer options you choose to compare when creating the Compare Rule will be used to cross-tabulate your data across the rest of the survey. Step 2: Collect Responses After you finish designing your survey, create a collector to distribute it. There are several ways to send your survey . You need at least 30 responses per answer option you plan to use in your Compare Rule in order to turn on and view statistical significance. TIP! You can buy survey responses using SurveyMonkey Audience. Target specific attributes, like gender, age, income, employment status, and more to get answers from the people whose opinions you need. Step 3: Apply a Compare Rule To turn on statistical significance, you need to add a Compare Rule to a question in your survey to divide respondents into groups. To apply a Compare Rule: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click +COMPARE . Click Compare by Question and Answer , unless you used an A/B test in your survey. Use the drop-down menu to find the desired question. Select the answer options you'd like for your groups. These groups will be used to cross-tabulate your data across the rest of the survey. Click the toggle next to Show statistical significance to turn them on. At least 2 of the answer options need to have 30 responses or more in each group order to turn on statistical significance. Click Apply . To edit your groups after you create the rule, click the down arrow to the right of the rule in the left sidebar and click Edit rule . TIP! You can create multiple Compare Rules, but you can only apply or view one Compare Rule at a time. Step 4: Examine Your Data Tables After you apply the Compare Rule, you'll see how each group answered each question in a side-by-side view so you can easily spot similarities and differences. We highlight answer options that are statistically significant in the data tables below question charts. Statistical significance is calculated for the following question types: Multiple Choice , Dropdown , Matrix/Rating Scale, and Ranking . Each row in the data table represents a response group. Each response group is also assigned a letter, which you can reference in the data table. Each column in the data table represents an answer choice. Hover over any answer option to see additional information. You'll see one of the following messages: Message Description Significantly lower than The group is significantly less likely to select the answer option compared to other highlighted groups. Significantly higher than The group is significantly more likely to select the answer option compared to other highlighted groups. More responses needed You need at least 30 response to calculate statistical significance for the group. Combined answer choices At this time, we can't calculate statistical significance for combined answer choices . Please uncombine them. Hidden answer choices At this time, we can't calculate statistical significance for hidden answer choices . Please unhide them. No significant difference The group selected this answer choice about as often as other groups. Scroll down the page to the section on ""What is a statistically significant difference?"" for more information. Step 5: Share Your Results Shared Data Pages If you share your survey results online, people who view your shared data page can view statistical significance. To create a shared data page that includes statistical significance: Select Rules from the toolbar. Find the Compare Rule you created with statistical significance. If there's a green check mark icon next to it, your Compare Rule is active. If it has a gray icon next to it, click the Compare Rule to activate it. Select Saved views from the toolbar, then click +Save as... Enter a name for the view and click Save . Click Save as in the upper-right corner of the page. Then, select Shared data link . Finish setting up the shared data page . Exports Statistical significance is included in Summary Data PDF and PPT exports. Your export notes responses that are significantly different with the letter of the response group they are significantly different from. To export results that include statistical significance, apply your Compare Rule and export the Current View . Survey Example You want to see if men are significantly more satisfied with your product than women. Add two multiple-choice questions to your survey: • What is your gender? (Male, Female) • How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our product? (Satisfied, Dissatisfied) Make sure at least 30 respondents select male as their gender AND at least 30 respondents select female as their gender. Add a Compare Rule to the question ""What is your gender?"" and select both the male and female answer options as your groups. Use the data table below the question chart for ""How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our product?"" to see if any answer options show a statistically significant difference. What is a statistically significant difference? A statistically significant difference tells you whether one group's answers are substantially different from another group's answers by using statistical testing. Statistical significance means that the numbers are reliably different, greatly aiding your data analysis. Still, you should also consider whether the results are important — it's up to you to decide how to interpret or take action on your results. For example, say you receive more customer complaints from women than you do from men. How do you know this is a real difference you should address? One great way is to run a survey to see if your male customers are a lot more satisfied with your product. Using a statistical formula, our statistical significance feature can help you determine if men have significantly higher levels of satisfaction with your product than women. This allows you to take action on data, not on anecdote. Expand | Collapse Statistically Significant Difference If your results are highlighted in your data table, that means that the two groups are significantly different from one another. Significance means that the numbers are statistically different — it doesn't mean the finding is important or meaningful. No Statistically Significant Difference If your results are not highlighted in your data table, even though the percentages being compared may be different, the two numbers are not statistically different. Responses with no statistically significant difference show that the two items being compared are not significantly different at your sample size, but does not necessarily mean that they are unimportant. You may be able to detect a statistically significant difference by increasing your sample size. Sample Size If you have a very small sample size, only large differences between two groups will be significant. If you have a very large sample size, both small and large differences will be detected as significant. However, if two numbers are statistically different, it doesn't mean that the results are meaningfully different. You'll have to decide which differences are meaningful to your survey goal. Calculating Statistical Significance We calculate statistical significance using a standard 95% confidence level. When we display an answer option as statistically significant, it means the difference between two groups has less than a 5% probability of occurring by chance or sampling error alone, which is often displayed as p < 0.05. To calculate the statistical significance between groups, we use the following formulas: *1.96 is a number used for the 95% confidence level since 95% of the area under a student's t-distribution function lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Example Calculation Continuing the example from above, let's find out if the percent of men who say they are satisfied with your product is significantly more than the percent of women. Let's say you surveyed 1000 men and 1000 women and found 70% of men say they are satisfied with your product compared to 65% of women. Is 70% significantly higher than 65%? Use the following survey data to complete the formulas: p1 (% of men who are satisfied with the product) = 0.7 p2 (% of women who are satisfied with the product) = 0.65 n1 (# of men you surveyed) = 1000 n2 (# of women you surveyed) = 1000 Since the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than 1.96, it means the difference between men and women is significant. Men are more likely to be satisfied with your product than women. Hiding Statistical Significance To hide statistical significance for all questions: Click the down arrow to the right of the compare rule in the left sidebar. Click Edit rule . Click the toggle next to Show statistical significance to turn them off. Click Apply . To hide statistical significance for one question: Click Customize above the question chart. Click the Display Options tab. Uncheck the box next to Statistical significance . Click Save . The swap rows and columns display option is automatically turned on when you show statistical significance. If you uncheck this display option, statistical significance is turned off as well.

Form Rules allow you to trigger an action after someone submits your form. You can redirect people to another site, create a customized confirmation message, or send an email—only when they meet your conditions. To create Form Rules: Log in and go to Forms . To the right of the form, If you're using legacy Wufoo, hover over Edit then click Add rules . If you're using the new Wufoo experience , click the ... More icon then click Form rules . Click the purple tab for Form Rules . Create a condition. Choose an action: Show Message , Redirect to Web Site , or Send Email . At the bottom of the page, click Save . At the top of the page, click View Form to test it out. TIP! Form Rules only trigger when certain conditions are met, as opposed to standard confirmation emails or confirmation options that occur whenever someone completes your form. Form Rules override those standard confirmation options, allowing you to have both general confirmation options for most people and specific confirmation options that only trigger in certain cases. Requirements Form Rules are only available on paid plans. Actions Show Message Displays a custom confirmation message when someone completes your form that only triggers when the condition is met. If the condition is not met, they'll see your standard confirmation option . By default the message is center-aligned, but you can use HTML to left-align the text, as well as add formatting, images, or links. You can also use Templating to insert form data into your custom message. Redirect to Web Site Sends people directly to a website of your choice when they complete your form, only when the condition is met. If the condition is not met, they'll see your standard confirmation option . You can use Templating to pass the Entry ID into the redirect URL. Send Email Choose between a notification email (sent to any email addresses you want) or a confirmation email (sent to the email address entered in Email field by the person who filled out your form). Send notification emails that only trigger only when the condition is met. If the condition is not met, your standard notifications take over, if you have them set up. If you have an Email field in your form, you can toggle from ""notification"" to ""confirmation"" to send confirmation emails that only trigger only when the condition is met. If the condition is not met, your standard confirmation email takes over, if you have one set up. You can edit the confirmation email in Form Rules the same way you can edit it in Confirmation Options, except you can't add a cc or bcc to confirmation emails set up in Form Rules. Using Multiple Form Rules You can create multiple Form Rules if you have a few different confirmation scenarios you'd like to set up. If you add multiple Form Rules, your form can (1) both Send Email and Show Message for the same form submission or (2) it can both Send Email and Redirect to Web Site for the same form submission. But it can't both Show Message and Redirect to Web Site for the same form submission. If any Form Rules conflict, your form will only follow the rule that comes last (the higher number) in the list. Example In the example below, we would follow rule 2 (Redirect to Web Site) but not rule 1 (Show Message) because rule 2 comes after rule 1. We'd also follow rule 3 because we can do both Send Email and Redirect to Web Site.

The accepted formats can be customized by you as an administrator in some tasks to suit the needs of your process. These formats can be altered within the Options (or File Options) tab of the Document/Image, Portfolio, and Attach File tasks listed below. Document Formats Portable Document Format File (.pdf) Microsoft Word Document (.doc) Microsoft Word Open XML Document (.docx) Microsoft Excel Document (.xls) Microsoft Excel Open XML Document (.xlsx) Attaching Word Documents and Excel Spreadsheets When a user attaches a Word Document and an Excel spreadsheet it will remain available within the site in its original format. Therefore, it can be downloaded from the site and viewed within Word or Excel. It will not be converted within the site or viewable internally within the system. If this is a process you require we would recommend restricting the attachments to PDF to ensure the file can be viewed online. Attaching PDF Files When a user attaches a PDF file, it's converted and made viewable within your Apply site. This conversion process only works for PDF files without JavaScript features enabled. Because JavaScript in PDF files can pose serious security risks, when trying to upload a PDF, you'll see an error message if the file contains JavaScript. If your process requires the use of interactive PDFs containing JavaScript to, for example, populate the current date on a field in your PDF, etc., removing the JavaScript may break that functionality. Admins may need to update workflows depending on the purpose of the JavaScript. Options to consider include removing the JavaScript from the PDF, using a PDF editor to create fillable forms that don’t use JavaScript. If applicants are submitting images in PDF format, consider using Image Upload instead. Removing JavaScript from PDFs To remove Javascript from a PDF, you can open the PDF in your viewer of choice and print to PDF. This process will retain pre-filled form information but it won't be editable. For more information on printing to PDF, see the links below for Windows and Mac instructions. Mac: Save a document as a PDF on Mac Windows: View, print, and edit PDFs in a PDF reader - Microsoft Support Video Formats In the case that you wish for your students to attach a video as a file, there are two available formats that are accepted. Audio Video Interleaved (.avi) MPEG-4 (.mp4) NOTE: Using the Linked Media attach type, you can have your applicants copy a link to their YouTube/Vimeo media instead. Audio Formats There are two formats available for audio files: MP3 Audio File (.mp3) WAVE Audio Format (.wav) Within the task settings, you can enable either of these formats or both if necessary. After the audio file is attached, click on the file to open it in a new tab. Linked Media Formats This attachment type allows you to collect videos from your applicants that are stored in an outside source. The two formats available are: YouTube Vimeo Applicants will be able to link their YouTube/Vimeo media to this task in order for the media to be considered with their application. File Sizes When it comes to file sizes we typically suggest a maximum file size of 1000MB. The smaller the file size, the faster it will be to attach the file and view it on the site. Within your attach a file tasks you can set restrictions on the file sizes users can attach. Having restrictions will ensure that the users don't exceed these limits. Files that are too large may experience difficulties while attaching or downloading the file in the site. If you do require users to attach larger file sizes, you will just need to be aware that this can affect the download speed when you are attempting to download applications from the site. You will want to download the applications in smaller increments, to ensure no issues or timeouts arise during the download process.

How to Find the Largest Value (MAX),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/largest-value/,"How to Find the Largest Value (MAX) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the MAX Function? Proper Formatting for MAX Expressions Limitations of the MAX Function Help Advanced Features How to Find the Largest Value (MAX) Apply How to Find the Largest Value (MAX) What is the MAX Function? Proper Formatting for MAX Expressions Limitations of the MAX Function Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. Using the MAX function you can return the largest value out of a list of values given by your applicants. What is the MAX Function? The MAX function accepts a list of floating or integer values and returns the largest one. This can either be used for a single row or column within a grid question, the table as a whole or a list of variables within the form. Proper Formatting for MAX Expressions The setup and formatting of the MAX expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the max expression should be set up as follows: {{ MAX(variable1,variable2) }} Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of MAX and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive Always close each MAX operation with brackets ( ) Can contain a (,) to separate values. Cannot contain any operators such (+),(-),(*), etc. MAX of Select Cells {{ MAX(q1[0],q1[2],[q1[3]) }} Based on Grid Indexing , this will give you the highest value of the 1st, 3rd, and 4th cells. MAX of a Column {{ MAX(q1[:0]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will find the largest value in column 1. MAX of a Row {{ MAX(q2[1:]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will find the largest value in Row 2. MAX of a Range {{ MAX(q1[0:4]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will give you the largest value of the first 4 cells. MAX of Reviewer Scores {{ MAX(q1.score,q2.score,q3.score) }} The value of the highest score given to one of the listed questions. Limitations of the MAX Function It would not be possible to perform any expressions or to have any other functions within a single MAX expression such as SUM to calculate the different variables together to then find the largest one. The best way to pull the largest value from this information would be to have to have the SUM operations on one page and pipe the totals to the next page using the MAX expression.

SurveyMonkey Login Updates,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/account/surveymonkey-login-updates/,"SurveyMonkey Login Updates | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article What's Changing What you need to do Linking Multiple Accounts Common Questions Help Your Account Login & Password SurveyMonkey Login Updates SurveyMonkey SurveyMonkey Login Updates What's Changing What you need to do Linking Multiple Accounts Common Questions We're updating the way you log in to SurveyMonkey to make it simpler and more secure. Soon, you'll log in using your email address instead of a username. This article has details to help you prepare for the transition. What's Changing We're transitioning to logging in with your email address instead of username. If you have multiple SurveyMonkey accounts with the same email address, they will be linked. This way, you can log in once then switch between your accounts. This affects: SurveyMonkey desktop and mobile apps SurveyMonkey Rewards SurveyMonkey Contribute What's not changing Your plan(s), billing details, or payment methods are not changing. Your surveys and survey responses will stay separate. If you have multiple accounts, they will stay separated by username. The difference is, you'll log in once with your email address and be able to switch between them. If you log in with SSO, your SSO account will stay separate. What You Need to Do Login to your account , and make sure you're able to access all your accounts, go to the My Account page and confirm your email address on file is valid, up to date, and one you have access to. If it's not, please update it so you're able to log in after the transition. Accounts will be linked by email address. If you have multiple SurveyMonkey accounts, check the email address for all of them. If you have accounts you don't want linked, change the email address to one that isn't on another SurveyMonkey account. Linking Multiple Accounts Multiple accounts only This section only applies if you have multiple usernames associated with the same email address. If you only have one username associated with your email address, you won't need to follow these steps. Depending on where you're located, when you log in after June 13 or June 20th, 2022, you will need to verify your email address and set up one password for all SurveyMonkey accounts associated with it. You'll only need to do this process once: On the login page , enter your email address instead of your username. This is the email address you have listed on your SurveyMonkey account. Follow the prompts to verify your email address and create a new password. Then you can review your linked accounts and choose one to log in to. You're all set! Next time you log in, use your email address and new password to access all your accounts in one place. Not getting the verification email? Check your spam or junk folder. If you still don't see it, add our IP addresses and email domains to your allow list, then request another code to make sure it comes through. How to switch between accounts After you've logged in and verified your email address, you can choose which account you want to log into. When you're ready to switch, click your email/username at the top right of your account and click Switch accounts . Then choose which account you want to go to next. If you don't see a username on this list, it may mean there's a different email address associated with it. You need to log in with that email address to access that account. SSO accounts stay separate and won't appear on the list. Common Questions Can I opt out? You can skip the log in process until September 2022 . After the deadline, you’ll need to log in using your email address and reset your password. If you have multiple accounts, your accounts will automatically be linked at this time. I can't access or don't know the email address on file. Each account needs a valid email address on file that only one person has access to. If you don't have access to the email address on your account, we recommend clicking Do this later or Forgot Email when logging in. This will allow you to log in with your username so you can change the email address on file to your current one. Then next time you log in, use that email address. Can I combine my accounts? All accounts will remain separate, meaning all surveys and data will stay in the accounts matching the username they were in prior to accounts being linked. If you want to move everything to one account, we recommend transferring all surveys into one account. I can't find my surveys. Changing the way you log in will not affect surveys in any way. All surveys will stay in the account they were in prior to this change. If you can't find one of your surveys, it's likely in a different account. Try switching between accounts to find it. It's also possible that the survey is in an account associated with a different email address. To check, try logging in with an alternate email address. I’m using the SurveyMonkey mobile app and want to switch accounts. To switch to another account that uses your same email address: Log out and close the mobile app. Open a mobile browser and choose Switch account from the dropdown menu in the top right corner. Select another account. Launch the SurveyMonkey app again. I am using an email address as a user name, but have a different email address as my contact email. You may already be using an email address as your login , but have a different contact email address on the account. The contact email address is the email you need to enter for this new login process. If you don't know what that email address is, you can troubleshoot here .

Proper Formatting for SUBSTR Expressions Help Advanced Features How to Return a Substring of Characters from a String (SUBSTR) Apply How to Return a Substring of Characters from a String (SUBSTR) What is the SUBSTR Function? Proper Formatting for SUBSTR Expressions Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. Use SUBSTR to return a set number of characters from a variable. For example, return the first 4 characters from the answer to a question. What is the SUBSTR Function? The SUBSTR function allows you to return a set number of characters from the variable based on the index positions defined in the second and third values in the expression. For example, if the applicant provides a 10 digit phone number to question 1, and we want to extract the area code of the number (the first three digits) we can use the expression: {{ SUBSTR(q1, 0, 3) }} . If the applicant responds to the question with 613555555, then the expression will extract and return 613 as the response. Proper Formatting for SUBSTR Expressions The setup and formatting of the SUBSTR expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the SUBSTR expression should be set up as follows: {{ SUBSTR(identifier, int, int) }} The first integer is inclusive therefore this is where the range will start. However, the second integer is exclusive, therefore the range will end with the cell prior. The second value defines the starting position of the substring ( inclusive ) while the third value dictates the ending position ( exclusive ). Returns the substring of characters based on the parameters stated in the expression The index count for the SUBSTR function is 0 indexed Each expression is always contained within a pair of double brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of STR and the last bracket Identifiers are case sensitive Always close each SUBSTR operation with brackets ( ) Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Single-page Applications (SPA),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/single-page-applications/,"Single-page Applications (SPA) | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article What is a virtual pageview and how does it work? Targeting options for virtual pageviews How are virtual pageviews set up? Help Survey channels Website Single-page Applications (SPA) GetFeedback Single-page Applications (SPA) What is a virtual pageview and how does it work? Targeting options for virtual pageviews How are virtual pageviews set up? This article is for GetFeedback Digital (app.usabilla.com). A Single Page Application (SPA) is a website that loads all of the resources required to navigate the entire site on the first page load. Much like tag managers and analytics codes, the default GetFeedback installation snippet is optimized for use on traditional websites where each page is loaded individually as your site visitors navigate through your website. However, if you are using a Single Page Application (SPA), you'll need to use virtual pageviews to indicate that a visitor has navigated from one page to the next. In this article, we will explain the use of virtual pageviews for GetFeedback web campaigns. To get started using virtual pageviews, you'll need: An understanding of campaign targeting Knowledge of javascript Access to your website's source code What is a virtual pageview and how does it work? Virtual pageviews are triggered by calling our Javascript API when a visitor switches from one page to another. When a virtual pageview is triggered, GetFeedback Digital updates and rechecks the current campaign targeting settings. On websites that don't reload the entire document - and therefore don't reload the GetFeedback Digital code - a virtual pageview simulates the function of an actual pageview. Targeting options for virtual pageviews Visitor on a particular page - GetFeedback Digital will re-evaluate whether the campaign can be shown on the URL in question every time a virtual pageview executes. It is necessary to execute the virtual pageview as otherwise a campaign could be shown on a page visited after your targeted page. Visitors after being on the page for X seconds - If a virtual pageview is triggered during a visit, GetFeedback Digital will restart counting the number of seconds the visitor stays on a page. Visitors potentially exiting the page after X seconds - If a virtual pageview is triggered, GetFeedback Digital will re-evaluate all the targeting settings to see if a campaign should execute when the visitor leaves the page. Virtual pageviews ensure that your exit survey targeting is accurate. Visitors having viewed at least X pages - By triggering virtual pageviews we increment the page counter, so a campaign can show after a visitor has visited the right amount of pages. Manual trigger - Since a campaign can only be shown once per page, a manual trigger will only work the first time it's executed. If a manual trigger is executed a second time (for instance because it's tied to a button click), the campaign will not respond. By inserting a virtual pageview in between, the manual trigger can be executed a second time. Triggering a virtual pageview allows visitors to see another campaign even if they have seen one before or have previously left feedback. Although adding virtual pageviews allow multiple campaigns to be set up, you’ll need to schedule your campaigns carefully to avoid issues triggering your campaigns. How are virtual pageviews set up? A virtual pageview is executed through our Javascript API , with the following command: window.usabilla_live('virtualPageView'); This command can be triggered when a visitor moves from one page to the next. Below you'll find examples of possible implementations across commonly used Javascript frameworks. Vanilla JS View raw code here. Angular 2 Router View raw code here. VueJS Router View raw code here. React Router View raw code here. After implementing the virtualPageView command, your website is ready to use all of our campaign targeting options.

The webhook pushes new feedback items to Trello and creates a card, list, or board. You can choose which elements of your feedback form to include on your Trello cards, lists, and boards. GetFeedback Admins and Power Users can set up integrations. Before You Start You’ll need a Zapier account to use our Trello integration. Creating a Webhook in Zapier First, set up a webhook in Zapier. We'll send feedback items to this webhook. When creating your webhook: Choose Catch Hook for your event. If desired, you can set up your webhook to Pick off a Child Key . This tells the webhook to only grab the child key instead of giving you the entire payload of the webhook. When it’s time to test your webhook, copy the webhook URL. You’ll use this URL to set up the webhook in GetFeedback. Leave this page open while you set up the webhook in GetFeedback. You’ll need to come back and test the webhook later. Setting Up the Webhook in GetFeedback You can only set up one Zapier integration per feedback button. To set up the Zapier webhook in GetFeedback: In app.usabilla.com, select your account in the bottom left corner, then select Account Settings . Select the Integrations tab. Select Zapier . Set up the integration: Button : Select the web button to integrate with the webhook. Push Feedback : Choose when to send feedback: Manually : Only send feedback when you want. With an email address : Automatically push all feedback items in which the email address field contains data. With a comment : Automatically push all feedback items that contain comments. With an email address or comment : Automatically push all feedback items that contain an email address or a comment. All items : Automatically push all feedback items to the webhook. URL : Enter the webhook URL. Enable : Check the box to turn on the integration when you save it. You can enable or disable it later. Select Save . Testing the Webhook in Zapier Once you’ve set up the webhook in GetFeedback, go back to Zapier and test your webhook. Below the webhook URL in Zapier, select Test trigger to make sure it’s working correctly. Setting up Trello in Zapier Now that you have the GetFeedback connected to Zapier with a webhook, set up the Zap to forward any feedback to Trello. To set up Trello in Zapier: For the App event , search for and select Trello . Select the action Trello should perform when feedback is given. Sign into Trello or connect your account. Customize the action. This determines how your board, card, or list looks when you send feedback to Trello. Test your action. When you’re ready, publish the Zap. If you enabled the integration in GetFeedback, we’ll start sending feedback items to Trello using the webhook. Turning the Integration On or Off If you didn’t enable the integration, you can turn it on at any time. If you want to stop sending feedback to Trello, you can disable the integration at any time. To enable or disable the integration: From app.usabilla.com , select your username in the bottom left corner, then select Account Settings . Select the Integrations tab. Scroll to the Trello integrations section, then select the integration to edit. To enable the integration, check the Enable box. To disable the integration, uncheck the Enable box. Select Save .

Help Payments & Billing Subscription & Charges Team Billing SurveyMonkey Team Billing Renewal Charges Charges for Adding More Seats or Inviting People (Team Overages) Viewing and Editing Team Billing Details Transaction History and Invoices Seat Type and Cost Not the Primary Admin? When you sign up for a team , you pay upfront for multiple accounts (which we call seats). The person who signed up for the team is the Primary Admin , and they manage billing for the whole team. If you’re on an Enterprise team, contact your Customer Success Manager to access past invoices, or for any changes to your payment or billing information. If you're not on a team, check out Billing Details to learn about your account's billing. Renewal Charges When You're Billed and For How Much You're charged for your whole team at your renewal date—your billing is consolidated so you can pay just one bill for all the accounts on your team. Your team subscription auto-renews every 12 months on the same day each year until you cancel it. You can check your next billing amount and next billing date in Billing Details , under Billing Profile. The next billing amount depends on the team size (or Total Seats) at renewal. You can check your team size at renewal (or total seats, which you can find on the Team Summary page). If you'd like to reduce the team size before renewal, please contact us . How to Pay How you pay for your team renewal depends on the payment method used for your last payment: Payment method How to pay for your team renewal Pay Now We'll automatically charge the card on file for your renewal as long as auto-renew is enabled. Pay by Invoice We'll send an email to you and the team billing contact with a renewal invoice. Your payment options and SurveyMonkey's bank info are located directly on the invoice. Charges for Adding More Seats or Inviting People (Team Overages) When You're Billed When you Add More Seats or Invite People to join your team (at any point during your billing cycle), you may be charged depending on whether you have seats available (or Empty seats) on your team. You can check the number of seats available (or Empty seats) on the Team Summary page. TIP! If you have Full Access and Contributor seats on your team, keep an eye on the type of seats you have available to prevent team overages. Scenario Will I be billed? I have seats available No—you can invite people to fill the number of seats you have available at no additional cost . For example, if you have 3 seats available, you can send 3 invitations at no extra cost. But, if you send 4 invitations, you'll be charged team overages for the 1 additional account. I don't have seats available Yes—you'll be charged the cost of an additional account for each invitation you send. The amount is prorated based on the day you invite them, and how much time is left in your team subscription. You'll be charged at the time the invitation is sent —regardless of whether someone accepts the invitation. How to Pay How you pay for team overages depends on the payment method you used for your last payment: Payment method How to pay team overages Pay Now We'll automatically charge the card on file for team overages. Pay by Invoice We'll send an email to you and the team billing contact containing a team overage invoice. Your payment options and SurveyMonkey's bank info are located directly on the invoice. Am I charged for deleting or reassigning seats? No, you aren't charged for deleting or reassigning seats: You can reassign accounts at any time at no additional cost. If you delete an account from the team , you can invite someone new to fill the seat at no additional cost. If you cancel an invitation or an invitation expires , you can send another invitation at no additional cost.

WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Decision Application has been awarded CONDITIONS Not required for this scenario DO Action Source Action Custom Fields Update Award Decision Custom Field Value Custom Field What year is this transaction for? Value 2017 Applicant Custom Field vs. Application Custom Field A common question that gets asked is ""What is the difference between Applicant Custom Fields and Application Custom Fields?"" The difference between this is that the Applicant Custom Field gets applied to the User's account, it's typically used for information that is specific to the user when they log in to the site. No matter how many applications the user creates, that custom field is going to be consistent across all applications. For example, the user's address, or their school student number, or even their favourite colour. That information is based on the Applicant that is logging into the site to create the application. An Application Custom Field, on the other hand, is applied to the application they create, and in cases where an applicant has multiple applications within the site, the values in the custom field may vary from application to application. An example may be if you wish to input the semester that the application is applying for. So if you have multiple cycles or semesters where an applicant can apply to the same program, you can keep track of the Fall application vs. the Winter application. Example: Let's use the example of our applicant, Tom Jenkins: We created an Applicant Custom field and enabled ""Add to User Sign Up form."" The field we created was for Phone Number so that we can easily contact the user by phone in the future. Now when we access Tom Jenkins's user profile we can quickly access his phone number that he input during registration. However, Tom Jenkins is creating multiple applications in the site: First application to Program A Second application to Program A Application to Program Z From each of these applications, we want to keep track of the semester in which the application was created. For example, ""First Application to Program A"" is Tom Jenkins's application in the Fall to Program A, and ""Second Application to Program A"" is his application in the Winter to the same program. Therefore, we set up two automations to apply the custom field when the application is created, with the condition based on the dates the application is created. As the ""First Application to Program A"" was created between September 1st and December 31st we can set an automation to apply the custom value of Fall to the Application Custom Field. Now the custom fields will appear as such: Applicant Name Applicant Custom Field ""Phone Number"" Application Name Application Custom Field ""Semester"" Tom Jenkins 123-456-7890 First Application to Program A Fall Second Application to Program A Winter Application to Program Z Fall As you can see from the example above, only one user response is required to collect the user's phone number. However, as the semester information is different for each application, an Application Custom Field is used.

Ranking Question,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/ranking-question/,"Ranking Question | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Creating Surveys Ranking & Rating Questions Ranking Question SurveyMonkey Ranking Question Ranking Question Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free The Ranking question asks respondents to compare items to each other by placing them in order of preference. In the Analyze Results section, an average ranking is calculated for each answer choice, allowing you to quickly evaluate the most preferred answer choice. Creating a Ranking Question To add this question type: Drag and drop Ranking into your survey from the Build section. In the question text field, write instructions that ask respondents to rank the answer choices in order of preference, 1 being the highest. It may also help to include what all the choices have in common. For instance, ""Rank the following ice cream flavors in order of preference, 1 being your most preferred flavor."" In the Ranking Choices fields, enter the answer options you want respondents to rank. You can add up to 250 answer options. Configure any additional options. Click Save . TIP! Try to limit the number of ranking choices to about 5. Asking respondents to rank too many items in relation to each other can be overwhelming. Add an N/A Option Under the Edit tab, you can choose to add an N/A column , and customize the label. When you add an N/A option to a Ranking question, it will add an N/A checkbox at the end of each row. If a respondent selects an N/A checkbox, that row will be greyed out and will not be included in that respondent's ranking order. It's important to make sure that even the lowest ranked options still apply to that respondent. If a respondent doesn't have the option to declare that a ranking item does not apply to them, they will be forced to include that choice in their rankings anyway, which might produce bad data. Additional Options Under the Options tab, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Require an answer Sort, randomize, or flip rows Change the question size & layout Enable question text A/B test Learn more: Editing Questions Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. Respondents can drag and drop answer choices in the order of preference. When the N/A option is enabled, you can also use the dropdowns to rank. Analyzing Results See example results (English only) » Average Ranking Ranking questions calculate the average ranking for each answer choice so you can determine which answer choice was most preferred overall. The answer choice with the largest average ranking is the most preferred choice. The average ranking is calculated as follows, where: w = weight of ranked position x = response count for answer choice 1 w 1 + x 2 w 2 + x 3 w 3 ... xnwn ----------------------- Total response count Weights are applied in reverse. In other words, the respondent's most preferred choice (which they rank as #1) has the largest weight, and their least preferred choice (which they rank in the last position) has a weight of 1. You can't change the default weights. For example, if a Ranking question has 5 answer choices, weights are assigned as follows: The #1 choice has a weight of 5 The #2 choice has a weight of 4 The #3 choice has a weight of 3 The #4 choice has a weight of 2 The #5 choice has a weight of 1 We apply weights in this way to ensure that when the data is presented on a chart, it's clear which answer choice is most preferred. If you chose to include an N/A option on the Ranking question, any N/A responses will not factor into the average ranking. Charts The Depth display option allows you to choose between the following options: Weighted Average : Charts the average ranking for each answer choice Distribution : Charts the absolute number or percentage of respondents that selected each answer choice The chart types available depend on the question type, and the display options you configure.

Hiding the Previous Button Editing Responses in Your Results Help Sending Surveys Collecting Responses Editing Survey Responses SurveyMonkey Editing Survey Responses Turning On Response Editing Response Editing Options How are responses saved? Hiding the Previous Button Editing Responses in Your Results You can allow respondents to edit their responses later. You can also edit a respondent's response in your results. Turning On Response Editing To allow respondents to edit or change their survey responses: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of your collector. From the collector options , click Response Editing . Choose one of the available Response Editing options for your collector type. Accepting Payments limitation Respondents won't be able to edit their responses after they submit a payment , even when response editing is on. Response Editing Options You can allow people who take your survey to edit their responses either while completing the survey or after they submit the survey, or you can prevent respondents from editing their responses after they submit them. The available Response Editing options depend on the collector type you're using. Expand | Collapse Web Link or Website Collectors The Multiple Responses setting affects your Response Editing options when using a Web Link collector or Website collector. Multiple Responses is Off If you allow one response per computer , you can allow editing even after the survey is submitted. In order for this setting to work properly, the respondent must use the same device and web browser they used to start the survey on because a cookie is stored in the respondent's browser that remembers their survey responses. Option Description On, until survey is completed or exited Respondents can change their answers on any survey page until they complete the survey or exit the survey. Respondents can return to the survey to pick up where they left off and/or edit previous responses until they click the Done button or until you close the collector . On, always Respondents can change their answers on any survey page even after they complete the survey. Respondents can return to the survey to pick up where they left off and/or edit previous responses until you close the collector . Off Respondents can’t change their answers once they leave a survey page.After respondents submit a survey page by clicking Next or Done, the Previous button is hidden. Respondents can continue to access the survey to pick up where they left off until they click the Done button or until you close the collector . Multiple Responses is On If you allow multiple responses per computer , you can allow editing during the survey, but not after the survey is submitted or exited. In order for this setting to work properly, no cookie is stored in the respondent’s browser to remember their survey responses. If the survey is accessed from the same browser multiple times, the collector registers each time as a new respondent. Option Description On, until survey is completed or exited Respondents can change their answers on any survey page until they complete or exit the survey. If respondents exit the survey and go back to it, it records a new response—it doesn't update their existing response. Off Respondents can’t change their answers once they leave a survey page.After respondents submit a survey page by clicking Next or Done, the Previous button is hidden. Respondents can continue to access the survey to pick up where they left off until they click the Done button or until you close the collector . Email Invitation Collector If you're using an Email Invitation Collector, the Multiple Responses setting doesn't affect your Response Editing options. A respondent can edit their survey responses from any computer since their responses are tied to their email address and not a cookie in their browser. Option Description On, until survey complete Respondents can change their answers on any survey page until they complete the survey. Respondents can return to the survey to pick up where they left off and/or edit previous responses until they click the Done button or until you close the collector . On, always Respondents can change their answers on any survey page even after they complete the survey. Respondents can return to the survey to pick up where they left off and/or edit previous responses until you close the collector . Off Respondents can’t change their answers once they leave a survey page.After respondents submit a survey page by clicking Next or Done, the Previous button is hidden. Respondents can continue to access the survey to pick up where they left off until they click the Done button or until you close the collector . Target Audience Collector If you buy survey responses using SurveyMonkey Audience , your survey is sent through the Target Audience Collector. We remove the Previous button from surveys sent when they're sent through Audience, so it's not possible for respondents to go back to previous pages to edit their responses. Additionally, if a respondent exits the survey, they can't access it again or pick up where they left off. How are responses saved? Responses are saved and submitted when a respondent clicks the Next or Done button on each page of the survey, or when they answer the first question embedded in an email invitation if In-email Response Capture is turned on and the question doesn’t have an Other Textbox or Comment field . Responses don’t automatically save as each question is answered—they are saved and submitted page by page as respondents progress through the survey. TIP! If the survey is a single page, all responses are submitted at once when a respondent clicks the Done button. If the respondent doesn’t click the Done button, they will need to take the survey again to submit their responses. Hiding the Previous Button If you choose to turn Response Editing off, respondents can still edit answers when they're on a given survey page, but not on previous pages—the Previous button is hidden from respondents when they're taking your survey. However, when previewing your survey design , you'll still be able to use the Previous button to go back and edit responses because collector options aren't active when using a preview link. TIP! If you don't allow response editing, edit the survey introduction to explain to respondents that they won't be able to go back to edit previous pages once they have submitted them. Editing Responses in Your Results Edit a survey response from the Individual Responses page in your survey results. You can edit responses from both the Table and Single view. To edit a response in Table view: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Click the Individual Responses tab. Find the response you want to edit. You can select a column header to sort responses by that column. Click the Edit button on the right side of the table. The survey will open in a new browser window or tab, based on your settings. Go through each page, editing the answers as needed. Click the Done button on the survey to save the response. To edit a response in Single view: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Click the Individual Responses tab. Use the left and right arrows to find the response you want to edit.

Set up your email invitation collector : Assign language codes to your contacts Enable the Translate message toggle Click on a language and customize that language version’s email message (repeat this for all your languages) Send language version email invitations to your contacts At least one language must be enabled in the Design Surveys Option in order to display the Translate message option in your Email Invitation collector. Adding Languages to Your Contacts You need to assign a language code to your contacts so they can receive the right language version of your survey.

Survey Introductions,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/survey-introduction/,"Survey Introductions | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Creating Surveys Using Survey Pages Survey Introductions SurveyMonkey Survey Introductions To add an introduction to your survey: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Add an Intro Page from the survey Build section in the left sidebar. Click the text in the design to edit the Page Title and Page Description . Learn more about adding and managing pages in your survey. Writing an Introduction It's a good idea to begin your survey with an introduction. Write an introduction with the assumption that respondents don't know much, if anything, about the topic of your survey. Use simple, clear language to briefly explain the topic and purpose of the survey. Your introduction only needs to be three or four sentences, or a couple of short paragraphs at most. Include the following useful information in your introduction: Your name or the name of the company or organization you represent The goal of the survey or what you're trying to find out How you'll be using the responses to make a difference If the responses are anonymous, confidential, or tracked Relevant instructions that aren't explained in the survey questions themselves Any consent statement or privacy notice required by your company or organization It's likely that some of your survey questions won't apply to all respondents taking your survey. You can use Skip Logic to guide respondents directly to relevant questions and have them skip over questions that don't apply to them, providing a better surveying experience for respondents and increasing the success of your survey project. TIP! Learn survey best practices and guidelines to help you get the insights you need to make smarter decisions at Surveys 101 (English only). Example Introductions Example 1 If you're looking to get feedback from your customers, make it clear what you're hoping to do as a result. This lets them know you recognize and appreciate the time they're taking to provide feedback. We're conducting research on the different question types SurveyMonkey has to offer. We'd love to hear from you about what question types you use the most and what question types you want to see built. This will help us make improvements to the existing tool and prioritize new features. The survey should only take 5 minutes, and your responses are completely anonymous. You can only take the survey once, but you can edit your responses until the survey is closed on May 28, 2014. Questions marked with an asterisk (*) are required. If you have any questions about the survey, please email us: youremail@email.com We really appreciate your input! Example 2 When using SurveyMonkey Audience , if you're targeting respondents who don't exactly fit your targeting needs, you can add a couple sentences to the introduction to encourage respondents to approach your survey as a hypothetical scenario. For instance, if you can't specifically target soon-to-be brides, you can ask married women to think back to the time when they were planning their wedding. We're a startup company looking to learn more about how women buy wedding dresses. Reflect back to the time if and when you were looking for a wedding dress, and try to approach this survey through those eyes.

How to Clean up your Applications for a New Cycle,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/clean-up-apps/,"How to Clean up your Applications for a New Cycle | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Why should I take these steps? Step 1: Labelling your Applications Step 2: Archiving your Applications Step 3: Allow applicants to re-use their responses Help Monitor Manage Applications How to Clean up your Applications for a New Cycle Apply How to Clean up your Applications for a New Cycle Why should I take these steps? Step 1: Labelling your Applications Step 2: Archiving your Applications Step 3: Allow applicants to re-use their responses This article will walk through how you can organize your applications from cycle to cycle and keep a clean experience for you and your users. Why should I take these steps? The important step in this process is Step 2: Archiving your Applications . The reason for this is that it ensures that applicants create a new application for the new cycle. When Applications aren't archived applicants can run into a variety of roadblocks including overwriting the previous year's applications or being restricted by application limits. Additionally, some automated process may not work as effectively if the application isn't new. Lastly, when the application moves to the Review process, the reviewer may see their old responses as opposed to being offered a new review form. With the use of Reusable Applicant Tasks , you can take Step 3: Allow applicants to re-use their responses . This will allow applicants the options of pulling from previously completed forms from other applications. This will help save them time when creating an application for the new year. Step 1: Labelling your Applications This step allows you to add labels to your applications for the year or cycle they applied to. This will allow you to easily locate these applications in the future. To label your applications: Create a Label . Name the label based on the year/cycle, for example, Fall 2018 Navigate back to your list of applications. Add Filters based on the date the applications were created. Add Application Details > Date Created -- is before -- [Enter the close date of your cycle]. Add a second filter for Application Details > Date Created -- is after -- [Enter the open date of your cycle]. Apply the Filter. Select all of the applications that match your filters. Add the label to the applications . Optional: Save your filter for the label to easily find these applications at a later date. Step 2: Archiving your Applications Once you've labelled your applications, you will need to Archive the applications. For more information on Archiving your applications, you can refer to How to Archive Applications . Once you have archived the applications, they will automatically be filtered out using the Status Filter at the top of the page. To locate your archived applications, you can switch the status filter to Archived Applications and use the Saved Filter created above to filter the applications by year. Step 3: Allow applicants to re-use their responses If the process will be the same from year to year, you can set your tasks up as Reusable Applicant Tasks . These tasks can be shared across programs, but they can also allow your applicants the ability to auto-populate their tasks with responses they've given in other applications.

Auto-Renew,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/auto-renew/,"Auto-Renew | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Payments & Billing Subscription & Charges Auto-Renew SurveyMonkey Auto-Renew Paid plans are subscriptions that auto-renew by default to ensure you don't lose access to paid features at your next billing date. You can check your auto-renew setting in the Billing Details tab of your account. If auto-renew is enabled , the subscription renews at your next billing date and you keep access to paid features. If auto-renew is disabled , the subscription doesn't renew at your next billing date. Instead, your account downgrades to a free plan and you lose access to paid features. You can cancel auto-renew at any time. This prevents your payment method from being charged at your next billing date, or if you pay by invoice, prevents your next invoice from being issued. How You're Billed Payment for your renewal is due at your next billing date. The way you're billed for your renewal depends on your payment method: Payment Method Auto-Renew is Enabled Pay Now The payment method listed in the Billing Details tab is automatically charged at your next billing date. Pay by Invoice We email you and your billing contact an invoice 45 days before your next billing date. You can also access invoices from the Transaction History tab. Payment methods and instructions on how to pay are located directly on the invoice. TIP! If you'd like to be emailed an invoice to pay for your renewal rather than be charged automatically on your next billing date, you can request to pay by invoice . Your Next Billing Date Payment for your subscription renewal is due at your next billing date. Most plans auto-renew on an annual basis (every 12 months) on the same day each year.

Web Overlay Surveys (Modals),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/web-overlay/,"Web Overlay Surveys (Modals) | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Getting Started Configure the Survey Installing GetFeedback Javascript on Your Website Add Merge Fields to your Web Overlay Survey Enable your Web Overlay Survey Help Survey channels Website Web Overlay Surveys (Modals) GetFeedback Web Overlay Surveys (Modals) Getting Started Configure the Survey Installing GetFeedback Javascript on Your Website Add Merge Fields to your Web Overlay Survey Enable your Web Overlay Survey Web overlay surveys are a great way to engage prospects and visitors when they visit your site. Add a GetFeedback web overlay survey directly to your site for all visitors to see, or use settings to target specific visitors, leads or prospects to ask for feedback. Getting Started First, build your GetFeedback website survey. Keep the content of your survey short and sweet. Web overlay surveys appear inside a small widget or lightbox on your site, so you'll want to keep the language and survey questions concise. You can't use merge fields to personalize web overlay surveys. However, you can add merge fields to track responses. Web overlay surveys collect a webpage_url merge field by default. This allows you to track where on your site the response was collected. If you want to personalize your survey with merge fields, use GetFeedback Web Embed surveys instead. Configure the Survey Next, we'll configure the location, style, and targeting options for your survey by navigating to Distribute > Website > Web Overlay . On the Web Overlay page, there are three sections of settings: Appearance, Appears On, and Triggers. As you make these changes, you'll see them reflected in the survey preview pane on the right side of the page. Appearance Type - You can choose a drawer or a lightbox. The ""Drawer"" option places a drawer at the bottom of your website. The ""Lightbox"" option displays a pop-up lightbox when the survey button has been clicked. You can toggle between the options to see which looks best on your website. Place - You'll have two options here for placement on your website: lower left or lower right. For the lightbox option, ‘place’ controls where the survey button will appear. The lightbox will always appear in the middle of your survey taker's screen once the button has been clicked to start the survey. Label - Adding a label allows you to add a call to action such as ""Contact Us"", or ""Provide Feedback"", or ask a question such as ""Need help?"" Mobile - While our surveys are mobile friendly, you can choose to show or hide surveys on devices such as iPads and smartphones. Icon - Finally, pick an icon and color that best fits your website theme and survey. Appears on You can use this section to control where on your site your web overlay will live. There are three conditions you can choose from prior to entering your URL(s): URL is exactly URL starts with URL contains Each of these options controls what webpage your survey will appear on. Triggers Set conditions for survey placement on your webpage including: How long a visitor must be on the page prior to pop up. Where on the page the survey pop up should open. How often a survey is triggered for a single visitor. Trigger the survey for a certain percentage of visitors. Close the survey window once a response is submitted. Installing GetFeedback Javascript on Your Website The GetFeedback Support team isn't able to offer consulting services for coding issues because of the many nuances that may occur within your organization. This is provided as an example of where to start with your implementation, and may not cover all use cases or work in all organizational settings. After you’ve finished setting up your overlay survey, you’ll need to access the GetFeedback javascript code by clicking View instructions in the bottom right corner of the template builder. You can also locate the code by going to Settings > Web Overlay > Edit . If you don't have access to modify the HTML on your website, no problem. Enter your web developer’s email address and select Email Instructions . We'll send them an email with instructions on how to add this code snippet to your site. Next, add the javascript snippet to each page where your GetFeedback web overlay survey will appear, just before the </body> tag. You only have to do this once, even if you create more overlay surveys. Only surveys enabled in the web overlay builder will appear on your site. Add Merge Fields to your Web Overlay Survey Track details of your respondents by using merge fields in your survey. This involves a bit of coding within the javascript snippet. Add your merge fields to the javascript snippet. We're using Contact ID as our example here: gf('setParameters', {'ContactID': 'FIELD_VALUE'}); Replace FIELD_VALUE with the information you'd like associated with the survey results. 'ContactID' is the field name and can be edited to whatever you'd like displayed as the column title within the GetFeedback results. When adding this to your code, this merge field will be added as a separate script tag that contains the function call to set the desired field. This might look like: View raw code here. Enable your Web Overlay Survey Now that you've installed the javascript on your site, and you've added merge fields, you can make the final edits to your overlay and turn the survey On. Finally, press Save. You can always make changes to your web overlay survey in the future, as long as you always save your changes. If your survey isn't displaying - review your network settings, firewall, or browser extensions that might affect javascript loading on your site.

Recurring Web Link Surveys,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/recurring-surveys/,"Recurring Web Link Surveys | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article How It Works Scheduling a Recurrence Getting Your New Web Links Editing Your Recurrence Analyzing Your Results Help Sending Surveys Sharing a Link to a Survey Recurring Web Link Surveys SurveyMonkey Recurring Web Link Surveys How It Works Scheduling a Recurrence Getting Your New Web Links Editing Your Recurrence Analyzing Your Results Recurring Surveys Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free Sending your survey via email? Learn more about sending a recurring email invitation . How It Works Setting up a recurrence makes it easier to regularly share the same survey and gather data over time. This collector option saves you time by automatically creating new Web Links , called Occurrences, at a frequency you choose. What's cool about this setting is that you can easily filter your results by each occurrence to see how people responded differently over time. 1. Design your survey 2. Create a Web Link Collector 3. Turn on Recurrence in your collector options 4. Get email notifications when each new Web Link is ready to share with respondents 5. Share the new link Scheduling a Recurrence To create a recurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Add a Web Link collector. From the Collector Options, click Recurrence and select On . Select the frequency that the recurrence repeats —daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Choose all other recurrence details, like when the recurrence repeats, how it's determined, and when it ends. (Optional) Edit the Reminder Email Address . Review your Recurrence Summary and click Continue . Click Save on the confirmation window to re-direct to My Recurrences. Once on My Recurrences , you can set up the rest of your collector options in the Template , or grab the link to your survey in the Occurrence. Tracking Respondents Web Link Collectors track IP addresses, but this information can't really help you track respondents . If you want to be able to match each response with the person who submitted it, add required questions to your survey to collect identifying information from respondents. What does ""Repeat By"" do? When you set up a monthly or quarterly recurrence, the Repeat By setting defines when in the month or quarter you want to receive your new web link. For example: To get a new web link on the 15th of every month, choose Day of the Month. In the Start Date field, pick the 15th on the calendar. To get a new web link on the 2nd Wednesday of every month, choose Day of the Week. In the Start Date field, pick the 2nd Wednesday on the Start Date calendar. Getting Your New Web Links Getting My New Web Link You can copy your new web link from the reminder email, or from the collector in your account. Each new web link is called an Occurrence. Each Occurrence name includes a number so it's easy to tell them apart. To get your new web link: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of your Recurring collector. Collectors with a Recurrence are marked with this icon in your collector list: From My Recurrences , click on the Occurrence you want to access. Copy the URL. Share the link. Reminder Email We'll send a reminder email each time a new web link is created. The email is sent to the address entered in the Reminder Email field during setup. By default, the owner email address is pre-populated in that field, but it can be changed. We recommend sending reminder emails to the person responsible for sharing the survey link. The reminder email can only be sent to 1 person and you can't customize the content of the email. Editing Your Recurrence Editing a Recurrence Any edits you make to the Recurrence Template affect future Occurrences only. To edit your Recurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the recurring collector you want to edit. Collectors with a Recurrence are marked with this icon in your collector list: Click on the Template nickname to open it. Open your collector options and edit the recurrence options. Click Save . Auto-Save You have to click Save when you turn on a Recurrence or edit options, but your changes are auto-saved when you turn off a Recurrence. Expand | Collapse Closing a Survey All Occurrences stay open until you close them. Turning off a Recurrence stops any future Occurrences from being created. If a collector had a Recurrence turned on at any point, you won't be able to delete the collector —it remains in your collector list. Renaming Occurrences The default name of each Occurrence includes a sequential number based on when the web link was created, but you can give it a custom nickname if you’d like. To rename an Occurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the Recurring collector. Click the Occurrence nickname. Click the name of the Occurrence Web Link. Edit the name and click Save . Analyzing Your Results To focus in on the results of a specific Occurrences in the Analyze Results section, you can filter by collector . If you want to export your results , we suggest an All Responses Data export in XLS format so you can easily sort and filter your responses by collector. Limitations Feature Limitation Customizing Survey Links You can't create custom URL endings for the web links in a Recurrence. If you create a Custom URL Ending, the Recurrence is automatically disabled—and vice versa. Custom Variables Custom variables don't work with Recurrences. Make sure to turn off Custom Variables in your survey design to make sure your Recurrence works properly.

This allows you to disqualify respondents who don't meet your targeting criteria or consent to your terms . Adding Disqualification Logic Question Skip Logic allows you to route respondents based on their answer to a question. You can choose to send respondents who answer a question a certain way to continue through the survey, or you can disqualify respondents from the survey based on their answer and exit them from the survey. To disqualify respondents: Add a Multiple Choice question (one answer choice allowed) to your survey. Add Question Skip Logic to the answer choices that will disqualify a respondent. Choose to skip to a Disqualification Page . Choose a disqualification option in the collector options for *each* of your collectors. (See instructions in the following section.) SurveyMonkey Audience If you're buying survey responses through SurveyMonkey Audience, disqualification logic works a little differently. You'll also need to choose an incidence rate if you used disqualification logic in your survey. Learn more » Choosing a Disqualification Option When you add Skip Logic to a survey, you can choose to skip respondents to a disqualification page. To edit the disqualification option for a collector: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector and access the collector options . You may need to click Show advanced options . Click Custom Disqualification . Choose between showing respondents a custom disqualification message, sending respondents to a URL of your choice, or showing respondents the standard disqualification message (the Survey End Page setting you have enabled). You can only select one disqualification option per collector. If you have multiple answer choices in the survey that can disqualify a respondent, they'll all see the same disqualification option, no matter what question actually disqualified them. Your Custom Disqualification can have up to 500 characters. You can control the font formatting used for your Custom Disqualification message by setting the Answer choice font setting . Viewing Disqualified Respondents You can see which respondents were disqualified from the Analyze Results section of the survey. Respondents are noted as DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response . To view only respondents who were disqualified, filter by completeness and select Disqualified responses . Example Qualifying Questions Expand | Collapse Example 1: You're looking for Netflix subscribers Let's say you want to send a survey to Netflix subscribers. To disqualify respondents who don't subscribe to Netflix: Add a Yes or No question to the beginning of the survey asking respondents if they subscribe to Netflix. Add Question Skip Logic to skip respondents who answer No (they are not Netflix subscribers) to a disqualification page. You could also choose to skip respondents who don't subscribe to Netflix to a separate page of questions asking why they don't subscribe or what sites they do use to watch movies online. Respondents who answer Yes (they are Netflix subscribers) are taken to the next page of the survey. Example 2: You're looking for people who've shopped at Walmart in the past 3 months Let's say you want to send a survey to people who've shopped at Walmart in the past 3 months. To disqualify respondents who haven't: Add a Checkbox question to the beginning of the survey asking respondents where they've shopped in the past 3 months. Add Question Skip Logic to skip respondents who select Walmart to the next page of the survey. Add Page Skip Logic to skip respondents to the disqualification page. You could also choose to skip respondents who haven't shopped at Walmart to a separate page of questions asking why they haven't or what stores they have shopped at. Since Question Skip Logic overrides page Skip Logic, only people who select Walmart will go to the next page of the survey. Everyone else will go where you send them based on your Page Skip Logic.

JCB AUD, JPY, TWD Discover, Diners Club USD Visa Delta GBP Carte Bleue EUR CartaSi EUR Elo BRL Making a Credit Card Payment Payment Unsuccessful If your credit card payment is unsuccessful, you'll receive an error message saying the charge didn't go through or failed. Please double-check your credit card information and try again. If you're unable to edit your billing information because the window is opening a blank page, please check your browser's security settings. If you have strict security settings, the window may not open properly. Try temporarily lowering your security settings or use a different browser. Expand | Collapse Re-enter your credit card details and billing address Most often, it’s something as simple as a typo or an old expiration date that’s causing the payment to fail. Don't use spaces or dashes in your card number. Additionally, make sure the billing address and postal code you enter matches the billing address and postal code on your credit card. Confirm your card security code (CVV2 or CID) This is typically a 3-digit code next to the signature line on the back of the card. For American Express, it's a 4-digit code on the front of the card above the card number on the right of the card. Clear your cookies or try a different browser If your browser stores your name and address, it might be auto-populating outdated information. Contact your card issuer If your billing information is accurate and your charge still won't go through, your card issuer may be blocking the payment. Card-issuing banks have many security measures in place for online purchases and subscriptions, especially when a card is being used for the first time. Pre-Authorization Charges A pre-authorization charge or fee is a temporary funds hold that may show up on your credit card or banking statement as a pending charge. It's a test transaction commonly used by online retailers to make sure the card is valid before running the full charge. If the pre-authorization fee is refused by the bank or credit card company, the full charge is cancelled, and the purchase won't be processed. When you update credit card details or billing contact information in your SurveyMonkey account, we sometimes place a pre-authorization like this on the card—it's just to make sure the new details are valid. This temporary authorization is not a permanent charge. It should be automatically removed from the card in the next few days (typically within 7 business days, depending on the bank) and the funds restored to your account. The void may be listed as a refund, or the pre-authorization fee may simply be deleted from your account history since it wasn't a real charge. International Transaction Fees Your card issuer or bank may add a currency conversion or foreign transaction fee to your payment. If you have a larger than expected charge, please contact your provider for information on what rates and fees may apply, as these are not controlled by or known to SurveyMonkey. Charges on Expired or Outdated Cards If your card has been updated but the card information in your SurveyMonkey account is out of date, you may see the charge posted to your new card. When a payment is sent to a card issuer, our payment processor uses the card details stored in the SurveyMonkey account. If this information is outdated, the card issuer has two options: they can choose to use this information to accept the charge and post it on the updated card, or they can decline the charge. If they accept the charge and post it on the updated card, on our end we may see the outdated card details or the updated card details.

Filtering Survey Results,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/filter-rules/,"Filtering Survey Results | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Creating Filter Rules Types of Filters How Filters Work Managing Filters Exporting & Sharing Filters Help Analyzing Results Filters & Views Filtering Survey Results SurveyMonkey Filtering Survey Results Creating Filter Rules Types of Filters How Filters Work Managing Filters Exporting & Sharing Filters Filter rules allow you to break down your survey results and focus on specific parts of your data. For example, you can filter by question and answer to view respondents who answered a question a certain way. Or you can filter by completeness to view only complete responses. When designing your survey, think about how you want to filter your results. If you want to see responses by group, make sure to include a question in the survey that will allow you to filter by that group. For example, if you include a question in your survey asking employees to select their department, you can filter by question and answer to view only results from human resources department. To view only completed responses from the human resources department, you can also filter by completeness. Creating Filter Rules To create a filter rule: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click + Filter . Select a filter type . Choose the criteria you want to focus on. Click Apply . You'll see any active filters at the top of the page. We'll also show the number of responses included in your filter, compared to the number of responses in your survey. Types of Filters Filter Type Description Question & Answer View only respondents who answered a question in a certain way. For closed-ended questions, select the answer choices you'd like to include in the filtered view. For open-ended questions , enter the phrases to include, separated by commas. Collector If you used multiple collectors , show only the responses recorded through certain collectors. Completeness Show only particular response statuses : Complete, Partial, Disqualified, or Over Quota. Time Period View responses submitted on or between a specific time frame . The Date Range filter uses the date the response was submitted. The Last 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days filters use the Last Modified date. Respondent Metadata Filter by respondent metadata : response time, IP address, email address, first name, last name, or custom data. Custom Variable If you used any Custom Variables in your survey, sort by a common variable or unique name. A/B Test If you used an A/B test in your survey, show only respondents who saw a particular variable. Tag For surveys using a question with open-ended responses, you can filter all responses by tags you've created. Language For multilingual surveys, filter by language. Sentiment Filter by the sentiment of open-ended text responses: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Range If you choose to show people their score and set up custom score ranges when creating a quiz, you can sort responses by those ranges with this filter. Response Quality If you have 50 or more responses, you can filter for poor Response Quality. You can review and keep your flagged responses or delete them to focus on high quality answer choices. How Filters Work Filter Logic A single filter rule uses OR logic. This means any responses that fit at least one of the filter's criteria are shown. For example, if you're filtering by Question & Answer and select both answer options A and B, the filter will include responses from people who chose either answer option A OR answer option B. If you want to see all options except for one, you can create a NOT rule by selecting all options in the filter except the one you want to exclude. Using Multiple Filters You can apply multiple filter rules at the same time to narrow down your survey data even further. When multiple filters are applied at the same time, they're combined using AND logic. This means that only results that meet all filter rules are shown. For example, if you apply a filter rule by Question & Answer and select answer option B, then also apply a second filter rule for responses tagged ""human resources,"" your results will only show responses from people who chose answer option B AND have a response tagged ""human resources."" Combined Filters PAID FEATURE: Combined filters are only available to customers on some paid plans . Once you've created a few filters, you can combine two or more filters with AND, OR, or NOT logic to do more advanced filtering. To create a combined filter: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Create the filters you want to combine. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click + Filter . Click Combine multiple filters . In the Combined Filters window, use the dropdowns to select a condition and a filter. To use NOT logic, select Does not match . Click + Condition and use the dropdowns to add another filter to your combined filter. Click the And button to toggle between AND or OR logic. In the lower right corner, click Save . Your combined filter will be applied to your results. To find your filter later, select Rules from the toolbar. TIP! You can save combinations of filters as Views . If your survey is shared with a team , anything saved in the Analyze Results section is visible to all collaborators when they access the survey. Clear names make it easy for other collaborators to recognize and use views in their own analysis. Managing Filters Select Rules from the toolbar, then click the three dots menu next to a filter rule to unapply, edit, rename, copy or delete it. Select the filter name to turn it on or off. A green check mark ✅ next to a filter means that the filter is active. You'll also see any active filters at the top of the page. Exporting & Sharing Filters You can export your results with a filter applied or share your survey results with other people.

Design Issues Help Analyzing Results Understanding Your Results Missing Survey Responses SurveyMonkey Missing Survey Responses When are responses recorded? What account are you logged into? Did you send the preview link? Design Issues When are responses recorded? As long as you send out the correct survey link, responses are saved and recorded in the Analyze Results section of your survey whenever: A survey taker completes a survey page and clicks the Next button to continue to the next page. A survey taker finishes the survey and clicks the Done button. A survey taker answers the first question embedded in an email invitation when In-email response capture collector option is set to on and the question doesn’t have an Other Textbox or Comment field . What account are you logged into? If you're not seeing any responses at all , make sure you're logged in to the correct account. If you have multiple accounts, you need to be logged in to the account where you created the survey. Did you send the preview link? Check the survey link you sent out. Responses don't record using the preview link . You'll know if you sent the preview link if the URL has the word ""preview"" anywhere in it. If you're using an Email Invitation Collector , the correct unique link is sent automatically when you send the message. If you're using a Web Link Collector , click on its name from the Collect Responses section of your survey to find the correct link. Design Issues The design of your survey may affect the results or your survey takers' ability to submit responses. Click a topic below for more information: Expand | Collapse My survey has required questions Questions that are required to answer can sometimes confuse survey takers. If someone clicks Next or Done and they haven't answered a required question, their responses from that page won't be recorded until they answer the question and click Next or Done again. My survey has question validation If you set a specific number range or character limit for an open-ended question, customize the error message to be specific about these requirements. This helps survey takers know what to do to successfully advance through the survey. If someone clicks Next or Done but they haven't answered the question properly, their responses from that page won't be recorded until they answer the question properly and click Next or Done again. My survey has Skip Logic If you included Skip Logic in your survey design, there may be logic on a question or page that is directing respondents backwards in the survey. This can create an endless loop that blocks survey takers from finishing the survey. Test each logic path using the preview link to confirm everything is set up correctly. You can edit a live survey , even if you already sent it out. My survey is long Pages that are too long can overwhelm survey takers. If you included required questions or question validation in the design, survey takers might not be able to find which question is causing the error if the page is too long. If someone exits the survey without clicking Next or Done, their responses from that page won't be recorded. Design your survey using multiple shorter pages so responses are saved more often. Track your respondents so you can see who has or hasn't submitted a survey response. Tracking must be set up before you send out your survey.

Form Question Types: Overview,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/question-types/,"Form Question Types: Overview | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Choosing the Right Question Types Question Types Help Build Forms Form Question Types: Overview Apply Form Question Types: Overview Choosing the Right Question Types Question Types SurveyMonkey Apply has 16 different question types to help you collect the data you need within a form task. These questions have different input fields or type of responses the user can enter resulting in more than 16 question configurations. It’s important to choose the right question and configuration so you can collect usable data. Choosing the Right Question Types Form responses help automate your workflow, assign applications to reviewers, and more. For example, if the user’s GPA is greater than 4.0, you can automate, or move, the applicant to the next round. Keep that in mind when choosing a question type. Think about the data analysis you want to perform before you build your form. For example, if you collect text responses, you’ll gain more insight, but limit your ability to analyze data in a graph or chart. Open-Ended Questions Open-Ended Questions, such as a text response, allow you to gain a bit more insight into your users. You can make a text response question Multiline in order to ask your users to give longer responses or write an essay within the form and even set word limits on the responses they give. Closed-Ended Questions Closed-ended questions, such as multiple choice, or dropdown, etc., allow you to ask your users questions and force them to give a specific answer. This can allow you to then report on how many users chose choice 1 vs choice 2. It also allows you to place a Score or value on the response the user gave or even create an automation based on their response. Section Headings Section Headings are great for adding additional text and headings within the form, however, there are a few limitations to them compared to the rest of the question types. Using Section Headings, you cannot: Create an Advanced Branching Rule based off of them Filter users or applications based on a section heading Add a section heading to a report Question Types Question types fall under basic and advanced question type categories. Basic questions are the most common and have a straightforward setup. Advanced questions require a bit more time and configuration to setup. Each question will have its own setup and configurations available. You can refer to the articles linked below based on the Question type you wish to set up. Basic Questions 1. Section Heading 2.

Keeping Your Account Secure,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account/account-security/,"Keeping Your Account Secure | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo In this article Your Responsibilities What measures does Wufoo take? Spam Help Account, Users and Login Privacy and Legal Keeping Your Account Secure Wufoo Keeping Your Account Secure Your Responsibilities What measures does Wufoo take? Spam Your Responsibilities With Wufoo being so flexible, a good amount of power and customization to collect any sort of data is granted. As a Wufoo user it is recommended to understand your data, and use best practices when viewing and accessing it. This way, you can ensure that the data submitted into your account is kept secure, and that you maintain the level of trust needed with the people filling out your forms. With that in mind, please look over the following guidelines. Secure Accounts By default, all plans (free and paid) are served over a 128-bit, SSL-encrypted connection which ensures that your data collected through forms, and viewed with reports, is protected. Email Notifications Because emails sent from Wufoo are not encrypted, data sent via the email notifications should not be considered secure. Depending on the sensitivity of the information, you may want to stick to viewing data solely through our secure RSS feeds or API . Encryption All our forms are served over SSL and are secure. Wufoo offers the ability to encrypt up to 5 fields for secure accounts on the Professional plan and higher . In addition to storing the data securely on our servers, encrypted fields will not be sent out in email notifications. This offers a good alternative if you absolutely need emails, but do not want certain data to be seen. Public Access The best way to view your Wufoo account is at home or work using a secure connection to the internet. This isn’t always possible with travel, so when you are viewing your data from a public internet connection, be informed that your data is at risk. File Attachments & Downloads Files will be transmitted securely to your Wufoo account. When it comes to downloading the file at a later date, there are a few notes you should take into consideration. All files are given a public URL — this means that if someone types in the URL, the file begins downloading. That said, the URL is encrypted and extremely difficult (if not impossible) to guess. This URL is available to you in the Wufoo Entry Manager and to anyone who receives email notifications for each form submission. Only share this URL with those you trust. When it comes to public reports, files are given a separate URL. This is so that when you delete the report, the files are no longer accessible. To sum up file downloads, there is an encrypted URL that will never change that you should share with those you wish to have permanent permission to a file, and then public URL’s for reports that only work as long as the report is available. What measures does Wufoo take? Wufoo leverages the expertise and top notch hardware found at SurveyMonkey , our parent company, to ensure that the integrity of your data is kept intact. Physical Security Wufoo's servers are managed in-house and located in a SOC 2, Type II audited facility that is located in the United States. The data center includes high-end surveillance equipment, security guards, visitor logs and passcards/biometric recognition. With fully redundant IP connections, independent connections to T1 access providers, redundant external and internal power supplies, daily security scans and encrypted offsite backups, you can rest assured that we are doing everything we can protect your valuable data. Network Security We have an outside routing layer that provides basic filtering to handle and manage any potential denial of service attacks. All network traffic then has to pass through one of our redundant firewalls, which are heavily locked down and allow only specific services to be made publicly available. Additionally, we perform periodical scans, including quarterly PCI scans by McAfee, to look for any potential vulnerabilities in our network or publicly accessible software. In regards to employees, we force outside access to the servers to use a 128-bit encrypted connection along with a strong password strength. Server Security We follow a large list of best practices to ensure server security. These include only installing needed services, diligent application of security updates/patches, detailed monitoring and file system integrity checking. We also have a very limited set of people authorized to access the servers (except through the public-facing services), with administrative access restricted to SurveyMonkey staff. Code Security In addition to implementing features the increase security, we have to maintain best practices on the backend to ensure your account remains secure. We monitor sessions to restrict access of your account appropriately, and have constructed Wufoo in a way that every account is isolated. Safeguards are in place to try and detect common attacks such as SQL injection and cross site scripting. Most importantly, we actively review our code for potential security (in addition to evaluating all user feedback) so that we can address any issues as quickly as they arise. Spam Nobody loves spam, so Wufoo does its part to try and prevent it before it reaches your account. We automatically enable Captcha on the backend if spam or bot activity is detected. This helps to block activity that's consistent with a significant bot attack. Even though we have made a mass attack on all accounts difficult, and even a single attack on a specific, targeted form challenging, some spam may still get through. In this case, consider options to limiting entries to one per IP or changing the Field Settings on the Email field to No Duplicates depending on how the entries are being submitted. Additionally, if you delete the spam entries yourself within 24 hours, they will not count against your monthly totals.

Piping Variables: Overview,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/variables-overview/,"Piping Variables: Overview | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What are Piping Variables? How to Format a Piping Variable Site Variables Program Variables Application Variables Applicant Variables Recommender Variables Reviewer Variables Organization Variables Help Advanced Features Piping Variables: Overview Apply Piping Variables: Overview What are Piping Variables? How to Format a Piping Variable Site Variables Program Variables Application Variables Applicant Variables Recommender Variables Reviewer Variables Organization Variables Piping Variables are an extremely useful tool to use in your site that can be used in both Forms and Emails. Piping Variables allow you to customize the text based on the user accessing the form or receiving the email. This article is an overview of how to use and format piping variables within your site. TIP ! In order to ensure that the correct variable is being used in the site, we recommend using the piping tool to pipe variables into forms and emails as this will also include any variables that are unique to your site. What are Piping Variables? Piping Variables are expressions within the site to reference other information that has already been provided. They are useful because they personalize the site to the user that is accessing it. For example, they can be used within an email to pipe in the first name of the user into the email, so instead of the email stating ""Dear Applicant"" it can state ""Dear Tom."" Within Forms, they can also be used to pipe from form to form, or within the same form in order to save time for the user. Instead of asking the applicant to enter the same information within different sections of the site, you can have a field for them to enter the information once. Then use Piping Variables to pass that information to other forms. How to Format a Piping Variable Although you can enter variables easily using the internal tool, you may also be required to enter it manually at some point or adjust a formatting issue should it occur. Piping Variables can be formatted in the following manner: Start your variable by adding 2 curly brackets {{ Add a space after the second bracket Enter your variable, for example, applicants full name would be ""applicant.full_name"" After your expression, add a space. Close your rule with 2 closed curly brackets }} An example of a properly formatted variable is: {{ applicant.full_name }} Site Variables Object Variable This will pipe from...

TIP! Follow these steps to set up your Email Invitation Collector before sending your survey so you can track respondents. Opened & Clicked Through Rates By tracking the opened and clicked through rates of your email invitations, you can identify where respondents need help and send more effective follow-up emails. Expand | Collapse Opened Rate Opened Rate = # Opened / # Total Invitations Your Opened rate is the percentage of recipients who opened the email invitation in their email client. The opened rate helps you measure which subject lines or email delivery times entice people to open the email invitation. To improve your opened rate: Send reminder messages . Write compelling subject lines. Schedule invitations when people are more likely to take surveys . Opened includes both recipients who only opened the invitation AND recipients who opened the invitation and clicked through to the survey. To find the number of people who opened the email invitation but did not click through, simply subtract the number of clicked through from the number of Opened. Clicked Through Rate Clicked Through Rate = # Clicked Through / # Total Invitations Your clicked through rate is the percentage of recipients who clicked through to the survey by clicking the Begin Survey button (or clicked the survey link). The clicked through rate helps you measure which email content inspires action—in this case, getting your recipients to click the Begin Survey button. To improve your clicked through rate: Make sure your content is easy to understand and concise. Provide a compelling reason to take the survey—explain what the survey's about, how long it will take, and how you'll act on the results. Click-to-Open Rate Click-to-Open Rate = # Clicked Through / # Opened Your click-to-open rate is the percentage of recipients who clicked through to the survey from the opened email. Invitation Tracking Setting Invitation Tracking Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free Track how many people opened your invitation and clicked through to your survey in the Overview tab of the collector. You need to keep Invitation Tracking turned on—it's turned on in the collector options by default. Invitation Tracking has two settings: On, show how many people opened your email invitation and clicked through to your survey Off, don’t show how many people opened your email invitation and clicked through to your survey You can't edit this setting once you schedule or send your first invitation in the collector. If you turned off Invitation Tracking, you're not able to turn it back on . Opened and clicked through data will still be collected in the backend, but you won't be able to see it in your collector. See Information about Page Tags in our Privacy Notice for more info. Invitations Chart Opened & Clicked-Through Rates Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free The Invitations chart tracks how recipients interact with your email invitations. This chart includes useful data like how many recipients opened the email invitation and how many recipients clicked through to your survey. Label Description Total Invitations The total number of email invitations sent to individual email addresses in the collector. This is also the total number of recipients added to the collector. Opened The minimum number of recipients who opened the email invitation in their email client—more people may have opened the email invitation because: Open data can't be tracked if recipients don't download images in their email client. Opened data can't be tracked for messages you send as plain text . Recipients you send plain text messages to are counted as Unopened unless they click through. If they click through, they are counted as both Opened and Clicked through. Unopened The maximum number of recipients who haven't opened the email invitation. It's possible more recipients opened it but weren't counted (see info on Opened in the row above). Bounced The number of recipients whose email invitation bounced and couldn't be delivered. Clicked Through The number of recipients who clicked through to the survey by clicking the Begin Survey button (or clicked the survey link). Opted Out Recipients who opted out from receiving surveys sent through your SurveyMonkey account. Responses Chart The Responses chart tracks how recipients interact with your survey. This chart includes useful data like how many people responded to the survey, how many people completed the survey, and how many people only partially completed the survey. Label Description Total Responses The total number of recipients who clicked through AND responded to the survey. Includes both Complete or Partial responses. Not all recipients who clicked through will respond to the survey. Complete Recipients who finished your survey—clicked the Done button at the end of the survey. Includes Complete, Disqualified, and Over Quota responses . Partial Recipients who started but didn't complete the survey—they responded to at least one survey question and clicked Next on at least one survey page, but didn't click Done on the last page of the survey. Not Responded Recipients who haven't submitted a survey response. To calculate the number of Not Responded, subtract the number of Total Responses from the number of Total Invitations. This info is also in the Recipients tab. TIP! You can calculate your survey response rate by dividing the number of Total Invitations by the number of Total Responses. In general, you can expect a low response rate if your survey is long, your survey language is complicated, or you send your survey to the wrong audience. Read our tips to ensure you're doing all you can to get the best response rate possible . Common Questions Expand | Collapse How do I view individual recipients or responses? From the Recipients tab of your Email Invitation Collector, you can see exactly which recipients have or haven't taken your survey. Use the drop-down menus to filter by: All Recipients All Responded Complete Responses Partial Responses Not Responded Opted Out Bounced It's not possible to filter by Opened, Clicked Through, or Unopened. You can also view individual responses from the Analyze Results section of your survey. Under the Individual Responses tab, you'll see the email address and response status tied to each individual response. What if a recipient opts out? Recipients can opt out from your email invitations at any time. The number of Opted Out recipients appears below the Invitations chart, separate from the total number of invitations you sent. This is because: Recipients who opt out may have opened the email invitation or clicked through before opting out. Recipients who opt out may have responded to your survey before opting out. Recipients may have previously opted out from your email invitations. Example Status A recipient opens the email invitation and immediately clicks the opts out link. • Opted Out • Opened • Not Responded A recipient opens the email invitation, clicks the Begin Survey button, and completes the survey. Then the recipient clicks the opt out link. • Opted Out • Opened • Clicked Through • Complete A recipient clicks the opt out link from a previous message you sent in a different collector. Then you add them to a new message and send the message. • Opted Out • Unopened* • Not Responded * We don't send messages to email addresses that have previously opted out, but we still include them in your Total Invitations as Unopened and in the Recipients tab as Not Responded. What if I send a single recipient multiple messages? The Invitations and Responses charts only count each recipient once. No matter how many messages you send to an individual recipient through the collector, they're only counted once in the charts. Example Status You send a recipient an Invitation message, but they don't open it. Then you send them a Reminder message and they do open it. • Opened You send a recipient an Invitation message, but they don't open it. Then you send them a Reminder message and they open it and click the Begin Survey button. • Opened • Clicked Through You send a recipient an Invitation message, but they don't open it. Then you send them another Invitation message and they do open it. • Opened Why don't I see Opened or Clicked Through in my chart? Opened, unopened, and click-through rates are available on Advantage plans or higher—get more info on your plan . Additionally, if you turned Invitation Tracking off, you can't turn it back on once you schedule or send a message in the collector. Opened, Clicked through, and Unopened may not be available in some of your older Email Invitation Collectors. This tracking feature was launched in June 2015. After the feature was added to your SurveyMonkey account, any new Email Invitation Collector you created from can include this tracking data. However, we can't retroactively include this data to older Email Invitation Collectors since tracking wasn't available when those messages were sent. Can I track invitations but still keep their responses anonymous? Even if Anonymous Responses is turned on, you can still track email invitations. This info is tied to the email invitation, not to survey results.

Star Rating Question,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/star-rating/,"Star Rating Question | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Creating Surveys Ranking & Rating Questions Star Rating Question SurveyMonkey Star Rating Question The Star Rating question lets respondents evaluate a statement on a visual scale of stars, hearts, thumbs, or smilies. A weight is assigned to each icon in the scale, so a weighted average is calculated in the Analyze Results section. Creating a Star Rating Question To set up a Star Rating question: Drag and drop Star Rating into your survey from the Build section of the sidebar. Enter your question text. Adjust the settings under the Edit and Options tab. Click Save . Question Settings Under the Edit tab, you can adjust the following settings specific to the Star Rating question. Setting Description Scale The number of icons displayed on your scale. By default, the scale is set to 5, but you can choose any number from 2 to 10. Shape The icons that appear in the scale. You can choose from Star, Smiley, Heart, and Thumb. Rating Labels You can enter optional text labels for any item on the scale. They'll appear right above each icon. Weights Changes the weights applied to each answer choice, which will affect how the weighted average is calculated in the Analyze Results section. By default, a rating of 1 star has a weight of 1, a rating of 2 stars has a weight of 2, and so on. N/A Column Gives respondents the option to select that the question doesn't apply to them. Adding an N/A column is especially important if your question is required . If the question doesn't apply to someone, they should have the option to choose N/A so they can continue through your survey. The answers from respondents that select the N/A option will not be factored into calculating the weighted average. Colors Use the color dropdown to change the icons to yellow, green, blue, red, or black. Spacing Between Icons To make the icons display closer together, you can change the Question Width under the Options tab. However, keep in mind that the Question Width setting applies to surveys on all devices, so a question set to 50% width, for example, would also only take up 50% of the survey's width on mobile devices, which may make the icons look crowded. Additional Options Under the Edit , Options , and Logic tabs, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Add an ""Other"" Answer Option for Comments Require an Answer Add Question Skip Logic Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. Answering the question is easy—to give a rating of 4 stars, for example, a respondent would click the fourth star to select it. The first, second, third, and fourth stars will fill in, and we'll record the answer as the weight assigned to the star they selected. There's no way to enter a half-star rating. TIP! If you send your survey by Email Invitation, you may be able to embed a Star Rating question in your email so respondents can answer with just one click. Analyzing Results Weighted Average By default, the bar chart will reflect the Weighted Average —the average star rating that respondents gave. We calculate this average using the same formula we use to calculate the weighted average for Matrix/Rating Scale questions—see the Analyzing Results section of the Matrix/Rating Scale Question article for details. Chart & Data Table Labels In distribution charts for the Star Rating question, labels display differently depending on how you used rating labels in the survey design: If your Star Rating question has no rating labels, the answer choice labels display the number of stars the respondent selected. For example, the answer choice label for a rating of 2 stars would be 2, the answer choice label for a rating of 3 stars would be 3, and so on. If your question has rating labels for all answer choices, every answer choice label displays the corresponding rating label that you entered in the survey design. If your question has rating labels for some answer choices but not others, the answer choices without rating labels display as (no label). You can edit labels directly on the chart in the Analyze Results section, or go back to the Design Survey section to add rating labels to the question. Chart Scale The axis scale of the weighted average chart may not match the scale of your Star Rating question automatically. To change the scale of your chart, adjust the Min and Max setting in your chart's Display Options. For example, if your Star Rating question uses a scale of 5 stars, change the Max to 5 so that the scales match.

Resuming Incomplete Surveys,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/builder/resuming-incomplete-surveys/,"Resuming Incomplete Surveys | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Testing gf_id Combining gf_id With Other Merge Fields Resuming Incomplete Responses and Preventing Duplicates Help Survey Builder Logic Resuming Incomplete Surveys GetFeedback Resuming Incomplete Surveys Testing gf_id Combining gf_id With Other Merge Fields Resuming Incomplete Responses and Preventing Duplicates By default, when a respondent closes a survey without submitting it the response is recorded as incomplete. If the respondent opens the survey link again a new survey session will begin. To let respondents resume their incomplete survey season, use our gf_id merge field in your survey link. Learn more about merge fields If you’re sending your survey using Send to List , Salesforce automation , or Quick Launch , we include gf_unique and gf_id by default, so you don’t need to add these as additional merge fields. To allow respondents to resume incomplete surveys: From your survey, select and copy your survey URL by navigating to Distribute > Survey Link . Copy and paste your link so you can edit it. Add a question mark ? to the end of the link, then add the gf_id merge field in lowercase. Add an equals sign = to the end, then enter a value that identifies the respondent taking the survey (for example, their name or email address). The value assigned to the gf_id merge field won’t display in your responses. To track information, like a respondent’s name or email, you may need to use additional merge fields. This key will look like: gf_id= mergefieldvalue (replace mergefieldvalue with your parameter, such as the respondent’s name). gf_id tells GetFeedback that the user can resume their survey session, and the parameter is unique to that respondent so we know exactly which survey session to resume. Testing gf_id To test gf_id with your survey: Add ?gf_id=yourname (replace 'yourname' with your own name) to the end of your survey link. Your link with gf_id appended may look something like this: www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_id=Jill Start the survey and answer 1 or more questions, but don’t finish the survey. Close out the survey in your browser before you submit your answers. Open the survey a second time. You should be brought to the section of the survey where you left off. Once you complete the survey, you can open the survey link to start a new response. Combining gf_id With Other Merge Fields You can combine gf_id with any number of merge fields to track additional information about each respondent. Choose the value for your unique parameter, like name, email, or a contact ID if you're using Salesforce. You can also use values like Case ID, or Event ID. You'll most likely be using a dynamic merge field that pulls data from your Salesforce , Pardot, or Marketing Cloud. For example, if your unique parameter is an email address, your survey link may look like this example. This example uses Salesforce merge field syntax, but the formatting can vary depending on where you’re sending the survey from. www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_id={!Contact.Email} Example : To let respondents resume a survey and also track their sure that their email address to know who submitted the response add the gf_id and email merge field. The example link below shows what your survey link might look like: www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_id={!Contact.Email}&Email={!Contact.Email} Resuming Incomplete Responses and Preventing Duplicates Combine gf_id with our other special parameter, gf_unique to prevent duplicate responses. Using gf_id and gf_unique together allows respondents to resume surveys, but only complete the survey once. Learn more about preventing duplicate responses If you use both gf_id and gf_unique, your link would look like this example: www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_id={!Contact.Email}&gf_unique={!Contact.Email} Using Parameters with Recurring Surveys If you use a parameter specific to a person instead of a case or event, that person can’t take this survey again. If you plan on sending the same survey on a recurring schedule, like for a quarterly NPS program, it’s best to use a merge field with a date range included. This allows respondents to answer this survey next quarter when the date range is updated for Q2 of that year. This example shows how you can add a date range to your link: www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_id={!Contact.Email}-H1-2019&gf_unique={!Contact.Email}-Q1-2023 Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Before your payment is processed, you can view free benchmarks in your survey results. Then once your payment is processed, your paid benchmarks automatically appear in your results. Do I have to use every question in my survey? You don’t have to use every question in the question set you bought in your survey. However, the more benchmarkable questions you use in a survey, the more comparisons you’ll see in your results. In other words, to view a benchmark for a question, you need to include it in your survey design. Question sets align with expert templates you can use to easily create a benchmarkable survey . Templates also contain additional questions that you didn't purchase and aren't benchmarkable. You can feel free to add, edit, or delete questions that are in a template, as well as change the look and feel of the survey. Can I edit benchmarkable questions? Although some benchmarkable questions can be customized, editing the question type or answer text can cause misinterpretation and prevent you from seeing benchmarks. For best results, we recommend you only customize designated parts . How often is benchmark data refreshed? Your benchmark data is refreshed quarterly (every 3 months) to reflect the latest changes in industry, location, and size comparison groups. You can see the exact time frame a benchmark includes below any benchmark chart in the Analyze Results section of a survey with benchmarks. Can I view benchmarks for any survey? You can view benchmarks in any survey where you use a Question Bank question from the question set you purchased. In other words, if you use a benchmarkable question in the survey design, you can see the benchmark in the Analyze Results section of the survey. Can people in my team see my benchmarks? Yes, if you're in a team , other people in your team can see benchmarks you purchase if you share a survey with benchmarks. Also, if you purchase Industry Benchmarks and then join a team, your benchmarks will stay in your account—you'll always have access to your paid benchmarks until your benchmarks subscription expires.

Your score represents the net percentage of your customers who are promoters of your company or brand. Overview The NPS methodology is based on the following question: How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague? (Not at all likely) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (Extremely likely) Based on the respondent’s answer, they’ll fall into one of three groups: Group Score Description Promoters 9–10 Loyal enthusiasts who will stay with your company and urge their friends and colleagues to do the same. Passives 7–8 Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who can be easily wooed by the competition. Detractors 0–6 Unhappy customers who have the potential to damage your brand. To calculate your score, we subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. A positive score indicates that your promoters outweigh your detractors. Creating an NPS Survey When you use our pre-built NPS template or question type, we automatically calculate your score. Simply add an NPS question into your survey or choose from several survey templates that include the NPS question. Expand | Collapse Adding and Editing NPS Questions To add or edit an NPS question: Go to the Design Survey section of the survey. From the Build menu, click Net Promoter ® Score . Hover over the question and click Edit . Click the drop-down menu labeled this company and choose from the options or enter a custom company, brand, product, or service. You can't edit other aspects of the question or answer text, since this would affect the NPS methodology and potentially disqualify the question from benchmarks . Click Save . Skip Logic You can apply Question Skip Logic under the Logic tab when you edit an NPS question. We automatically group the answer choices into Detractors, Passives, and Promoters so you can direct respondents to follow-up questions accordingly. TIP! If you use the Net Promoter ® Score Template, we add skip logic to the template for you. Using NPS Templates To use or preview a template, create a survey in your account and choose to start with a template. Below are some of our most popular templates that include the NPS question. Category Templates Customer Feedback • Net Promoter® Score Template • Customer Satisfaction Template • Customer Service Template • Software and App Customer Feedback with NPS® Human Resources • Employee Performance Template Events • General Event Feedback • Professional Event Feedback • Entertainment Event Feedback Education • University Instructor Evaluation Template • University Faculty Satisfaction Template Net Promoter Score Template The Net Promoter Score Template begins with the NPS question and features built-in logic that directs your customers to an open-ended follow-up question based on their response.

The last page of the template includes a series of demographic questions, giving you further insight into who comprises your customer base. Start from a template!

Browse templates » Sending Your NPS Survey If you send your survey via Email Invitation , you can embed the NPS question in your email so customers can respond to your survey with just one click in their email. You can also send an NPS survey using any of our collector types . Analyzing Your NPS Results We automatically calculate your NPS in the Analyze Results section of your survey. Your NPS can range from -100 (all Detractors) to 100 (all Promoters). Any positive number score means that the percentage of customers who are Promoters outweighs the percentage of your customers who are Detractors. By default, your score will be expressed in an easy-to-use Gauge Chart. Below the chart in the data table, you can see the exact number of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. Expand | Collapse Calculating NPS To calculate your NPS, we use the following equation: (% of customers who are Promoters) - (% of customers who are Detractors) = Net Promoter Score Since an NPS must always be a whole number, we round the percentages of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters to the nearest whole number before calculating. Customizing NPS Charts To edit an NPS chart: Go to the Analyse Results section of the survey Click Customize in the upper-right corner of the NPS question. In the Chart Type tab, choose from three Net Promoter Score chart types that display your score only. Or, you can use Distribution charts to display the breakdown of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters: In the Display Options tab, click the Depth Menu to choose how you want the data displayed. Chart Types Chart Type Description Gauge Chart The default chart that displays your NPS on a gauge ranging from -100 to 100. Horizontal Bar The x-axis ranges from -100 to 100 and your score is charted accordingly. Vertical Bar The y-axis ranges from -100 to 100 and your score is charted accordingly. Horizontal or Vertical Bar Detractors, Passives, and Promoters are each expressed as a separate bar. Stacked Horizontal or Vertical Bar Detractors, Passives, and Promoters are displayed on a single bar that represents 100% of your respondents. Display Options Display Option Description Score Charts your overall NPS only. Distribution Charts the distribution of the three customer groups: Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. Detailed Distribution Charts the distribution of each answer choice on the NPS scale of 0-10. Learn more: Display Options Editing Restrictions You cannot change the chart colors or labels. The colors and labels we use by default represent the three customer groups: Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. Benchmarks When you use a certified NPS question, benchmarks may be available in your survey results so you can compare your results to others who used the NPS question in a side-by-side view. Knowing which quartiles your NPS falls between allows you to better understand where you stand in comparison to the organizations included in the benchmark. Filter Rules When you create a Filter Rule on an NPS question, we automatically group the answer choices into three groups: Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. You can click the down arrows to the right of each group to instead focus on the individual answer options 0–10. Data Trends You can use Data Trends to see how your NPS has changed over time.

Click the form you want to edit. Click the Add a Field tab. Decide which Field Type you need. Once you decide which one you want, there are two ways to add it: Click the field type to add it to the end of your form. Drag and drop the field type anywhere on your form. Click the field you just added to open its Field Settings and adjust the options. Click Save Form . Field Limit Per Form The number of fields you can add to a form is limited by the maximum row size limit of 65112 bytes per form. Because some field types count as more than 1 field toward this limit, the total number of fields you can add to a form may vary. . For example: Checkboxes : Each answer choice counts as 601 bytes toward the limit. Likert : Each row counts as 1021 bytes toward the limit. Address : Counts as 6121 bytes toward the limit. To avoid reaching the maximum row size limit, we suggest: Being selective of the types of the field types you use; Consolidating some questions into a single field, or; Creating multiple forms to accommodate your requirements If you hit the field limit, there's no way to extend it. However, you may consider this workaround to combine two forms: How to Seamlessly Stitch Large Wufoo Forms Together To help you format your form, the table below shows how many bytes each question/field type contributes to this limit: Question Type Number of Subfields Total Size (bytes) Likert 1 per row 1021 * num rows Checkbox 1 per option 601 * num options Address 6 6126 Name 2 2042 Single Line Text 1 1021 Multiple Choice 1 1021 Dropdown 1 1021 File Upload 1 1021 Website 1 1021 Email 1 401 Phone/Europhone 1 201 Paragraph Text 1 12 Number 1 8 Price 1 8 Date/Eurodate 1 3 Time 1 3 Rating 1 1 Managing Fields Delete a Field To delete a field: Log in and go to Forms .

Question & Answer Piping,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/question-answer-piping/,"Question & Answer Piping | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview How Question & Answer Piping Works Adding Piping Survey Behavior Analyzing Your Results Help Creating Surveys Applying Logic Question & Answer Piping SurveyMonkey Question & Answer Piping Video Overview How Question & Answer Piping Works Adding Piping Survey Behavior Analyzing Your Results Question and Answer Piping Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free Question & Answer Piping allows you to insert, or ""pipe,"" answer text from a previous question into a question on a later page in the survey. Video Overview How Question & Answer Piping Works Question & Answer Piping is related to Advanced Piping , which is a more advanced version of the feature that lets you insert custom variables and custom data from Contacts into your survey in addition to answer text from a previous question. For example, here's how you might set up a survey using Question & Answer Piping: Page 1, Q1: Single Textbox In what city do you currently live? Page 2, Q2: Matrix/Rating Scale How satisfied are you with the following aspects of {{ Q1 }}? Public Transportation Safety Education Housing Costs If the survey taker enters ""New York"" for Q1, ""New York"" would replace {{ Q1 }} in the follow-up question. For that specific survey taker, Q2 would then read ""How satisfied are you with the following aspects of New York?"" Adding Piping Adding piping requires that you add a sender question, and one or more receiver questions on a later page. A sender question is a question whose answer you want to insert into a later receiver question in the survey. You can pipe the same answer from a sender question up to 4 times in the survey. Piping is activated when a survey taker clicks Next to go to the next page, so a receiver question can't be on the same page as the associated sender question. Only apply piping after the design is complete. Piping will not dynamically update if you add questions in an order that changes the original question numbers. Expand | Collapse Sender Question Types You can pipe answer text from the following question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown Image Choice (only captions) Comment Box Single Textbox Slider Receiver Question Types You can pipe answer text into the following question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown Net Promoter Score Matrix/Rating Scale Single Textbox Multiple Textboxes Ranking Comment Box Date/Time Text Text A/B Test Image A/B Test You can also pipe answer text into the following question types, with a few exceptions: Matrix of Dropdown Menus: You can pipe text into row labels and column labels, but not answer choices (the text that appears in the dropdown menus). You can also pipe answer text into ""Other"" answer option labels. To pipe answer text into a following question: In the Design Survey section, click the receiver question—the question you want to customize with piped text. This must be a question on a page that comes after the sender question. Click the question text or answer choice field into which you want to pipe a previous answer, and leave your cursor in the position where you want to insert the piped text. Click Insert text from... . If there are sender questions that you can pipe from, they will appear in a menu. Choose the sender question you want to pipe from. This will insert the absolute question number within curly brackets. For example: {{ Q2 }}. When people take the survey, the bracketed template will be replaced by the respondent's answer to the sender question. Piping Error Question and Answer Piping isn't supported when Page Randomization is applied to either the page that contains the sender question, or the page that contains the receiver question. If you receive an error that prevents you from saving a question with piping, remove the Page Randomization on those pages, or remove the piping from the question. Piping may not work when applied to an 'Other' answer choice that has been carried forward . Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to survey takers. If a survey taker skips the sender question, the bracketed template won't show in the receiver questions—it's replaced by a blank space. You may want to make the sender question required to avoid incomplete sentences or blank spaces. Analyzing Your Results In the Analyze Results section, piped answers appear as bracketed templates, the same way they do in the Design Survey section. For example, 'How satisfied are you with the following aspects of {{ Q1 }}?' Survey takers will see the piped text when they’re taking the survey for a more personalized experience. You can filter your results by question and answer to see how piped answers relate to the rest of a survey taker's responses.

If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM). How it Works A Custom Sender Name and Email Domain lets you specify the display name and email address when you send surveys with the Email Invitation . It's what survey-takers see in the From field of the email asking them to take your survey. It replaces the SurveyMonkey sender name and email . Using a Custom Sender Name and Email Domain makes it more likely for your emails to be delivered and for survey-takers to open the survey and respond when they recognize your familiar and trusted brand. Team members can then choose to update the display name and local name when selecting their email's collector options. Replies to Email Invitations Your Primary Admin can also choose a reply-to email address for any bounced emails or replies to email invitations sent using the Custom Sender Name and Email Domain. The reply-to email can either be the survey sender's account email address or a listserv email. To know what to expect if you use a Custom Sender Name and Email Domain, reach out to your Primary Admin. Setting up a Custom Sender Name and Email Domain Your team's Primary Admin should reach out to their CSM to set up a Custom Sender Name and Email Domain. Here's a high-level breakdown of what to expect during setup. Send us your chosen Custom Sender Name and Email Domain We need these details: Display name Local name Custom email domain. We recommend using a subdomain of your company’s domain. (Optional) Reply-to email address Update your DNS Your CSM will send you DKIM/CNAME and MX/SPF records that your IT department needs to add to your DNS. Let us know once this is complete so your CSM can confirm everything looks good from our side. Otherwise, they can help you troubleshoot. Start sending branded Email Invitations The Primary Admin should let team members with Custom Sender Name and Email Domain turned on know what to expect, including where replies to emails will go. Once set up, surveys sent via Email Invitation will use the team’s Custom Sender Name and Email Domain. Any emails sent or scheduled before the Custom Sender Name and Email was set up will send from the SurveyMonkey sender email address.

Common Questions Expand | Collapse Can we set up more than one Custom Sender Name and Email Domain? Nope—your team can only have one Custom Sender Name and Email Domain. Is this feature available if my data is stored in the European Union (EU) or Canada? Yes—Custom Sender Name and Email Domain is available no matter where your data is stored . Why do you recommend using a subdomain? While you can choose to use a top level domain, it isn’t industry best practice.

There are browser extensions like Google Analytics Debugger for Chrome that can help you find the name of your tracking code. Adding Data to a Custom Analytics Report We will now look into setting up a custom report, to display the GetFeedback for Web and App data within Google Analytics. First, log in to your Google Analytics account. Go to Customization > + New custom report . Enter a title for your custom report and enter a name for your report tab. Add the following four metrics: visitors, Unique Events, Pages / Session, and Avg. Value. Add the following Dimension drill-downs: Event category, Event action, Page, and Event label. Select Save and your report should be ready. Google Analytics doesn't display data in real time, so it may take a few hours before the report shows your data. Google Analytics Events The following actions are available to indicate how a visitor interacted with GetFeedback for Web and App on your website. Event Name Description Feedback: Open Fires every time someone clicks the feedback button. Feedback: Success Fhis event fires every time a visitor completes the feedback process. Campaign: Open Fires when a visitor opens a campaign. Campaign: Close Fires when a visitor clicks the close button of a campaign. Campaign: Success Fires when the user submits their campaign responses on the last page of the campaign, clicks the redirect button of a Recruit Participants survey or when the user provides feedback while a Boost live feedback campaign is active. Campaign: Feedback Clicked Fires when the user clicks the call to action button in a Boost live Feedback campaign. The ""Feedback:Open"" event is also fired. Campaign: Page Switch Fires whenever the visitor clicks the next page in a campaign survey. This event also fires when a visitor clicks the submit button. Google Analytics Feedback Below you’ll find the information sent with each event and how they map to different variables. Feedback button: Event Category : Defined in the GetFeedback for Web and App backend when setting up the integration Event Action : A description of how the visitor interacted with GetFeedback for Web and App Event Label : The comment submitted with the feedback item Event Value : The mood rating score a visitor provided, 1 being the most negative score, 5 being the most positive score Campaigns : Event Category : Defined in the GetFeedback for Web and App backend when setting up the integration Event Action : A description of how the visitor interacted with GetFeedback for Web and App Event Label : The analytics ID of the specific campaign Integrating GetFeedback with Google Analytics using GTM You can also integrate GetFeedback data into Google Analytics (GA) using Google Tag Manager’s (GTM) data layer. This integration will work with the following GetFeedback products: Feedback Button Understanding the Data Layer A data layer is a JavaScript array that can store information. It acts as a simple database that lives on a website, where you can store valuable information about your users or page content. The information collected in the data layer can be everything from key attributes of a website (URL, page title, etc.) to information for marketing or analytics tags, like campaign ID, purchase history, or other user data. The data layer gives you a single data point where you can store and access all your third-party data. It also enables you to easily integrate with other third-party technologies. Pushing GetFeedback Data to GTM Data Layer First, you’ll need to add a code snippet into a tag in Google Tag Manager. This code snippet will make sure that all feedback that's left, is getting pushed into the data layer. In GTM, click Tags > New > Tag Configuration . Choose the tag type “ Custom HTML ” then copy and paste the code snippet below into the custom HTML tag: View raw code here. Make sure that you activate this tag after the GetFeedback button code has been activated. If you installed the GetFeedback button code as a tag in GTM, you can do this by clicking the “ Tag Sequencing ” tab and setting rules. Creating Data Layer Variables in GTM Now it's time to create some variables in Google Tag Manager. These variables will connect the data in the data layer with GTM. In your main GTM view, go to “ Variables ” and click on “ New ”. In the variable configuration window, select “ Data Layer Variable ” as variable type: The variables you create in this step depend on what data you want to send to Google Analytics. Here, we'll use the standard variables ""category"", ""action"", ""label"" and ""value"" from our event callback method. To get an overview of the data that's stored in these variables, then take a look at our support article Using Event Callbacks . This article also maps out the information that’s accessible on the different actions with the GetFeedback form; Open, Close, Submit, etc. Now let’s get back to creating our variables. We will create 4 data layer variables in this example. Give each of them a descriptive name, but make sure that you give it the correct data layer variable name. Variable names should be the same in GetFeedback and Google Tag Manager. Now, we shall have these data layer Variables created in our Google Tag Manager account: Creating a Trigger for a Custom Event in GTM To send the data layer variables to Google Analytics, we need to define a trigger for when a user interacts with GetFeedback. Go to “ Triggers ” then select “ New ”. Select the “ Custom Event ” trigger type. Enter Usabilla as the Event name Next, choose “ All Custom Events ” Connecting Data from Data Layer Variables to a GA Event Tag To recap what you’ve done so far: You’ve made sure that GetFeedback data is sent to the data layer You’ve created and connected data layer variables You’ve created a trigger in GTM that fires every time a GetFeedback action activates our Event Callback Method. Now you need to connect what you’ve created so far to Google Analytics. Go to your main GTM view, click on “ Tags ”, then “ New ”. When clicking on Tag Type add a “ Google Analytics - Universal Analytics ” tag. As Track Type select “ Event ”. Connect the data layer Variables by mapping them out, one by one, from the slide-out menu that appears. Last, but not least, add the GetFeedback trigger that we just created. Your final setup should look like this: Creating a Custom Report in Google Analytics You’ve pulled data from the data layer and into Google Analytics. Now you can present your data in a Google Analytics report. How you create your custom report depends on which data you've pushed into Google Analytics. In our example, we'll make use of the information that's sent along with the variables category, action, label, and value: Within Google Analytics click on the "" Customization "" tab, then "" Custom Reports "" and after that on the "" New Custom Report "" button. Enter a title for your custom report and enter a name for your report tab. Add the following four metrics: Users, Unique Events, Pages / Session, and Avg. Value. Add the following Dimension drill-downs: Event category, Event action, Page, and Event label. Optional: You can also add a filter.

Adding an N/A (Not Applicable) Option,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/not-applicable-option/,"Adding an N/A (Not Applicable) Option | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Matrix/Rating Scale Ranking Adding an N/A Option to Other Question Types Help Creating Surveys Question Settings Adding an N/A (Not Applicable) Option SurveyMonkey Adding an N/A (Not Applicable) Option Matrix/Rating Scale Ranking Adding an N/A Option to Other Question Types You can add an N/A (not applicable) column to any question type that uses weights: Matrix/Rating Scale (with the Use Weights option applied) Ranking When respondents select the N/A answer option, that answer will not be factored into the question's weighted average calculations in the Analyze Results section. To add an N/A column to a Matrix/Rating Scale or Ranking question: Click the Design Survey tab. Click a Matrix/Rating Scale or Ranking question to edit it. Or, add a new one. Below the answer choice fields, select Add a N/A column . NOTE: If you are using a Matrix/Rating Scale question, this option will not appear until you select the Use Weights option. The N/A answer choice field will appear among the rest of the choices. If you want the label to say something other than ""N/A"", you can enter a new label (optional). Click Save . Matrix/Rating Scale When you add an N/A column to a Matrix/Rating Scale question (with the Use Weights option applied), an N/A column without a weight associated with it will be added to the column choices. If a rating item does not apply to a respondent, an N/A column will give the respondent an opportunity to essentially opt out of the question, instead of choosing an inaccurate answer. Ranking When you add an N/A option to a Ranking question, it will add an N/A checkbox at the end of each row. If a respondent selects an N/A checkbox, that row will be greyed out and will not be included in that respondent's ranking order. Respondents answer a Ranking question by dragging and dropping their answers in order of preference, so you want to make sure that even the lowest ranked options still apply to that respondent. If a respondent doesn't have the option to declare that a ranking item does not apply to them, they will be forced to include that choice in their rankings anyway, which might produce bad data. Adding an N/A Option to Other Question Types You can also add an N/A option as an additional answer choice to other question types, like Multiple Choice, but the system will not automatically remove those choices from analysis. To learn more about the pros and cons of the N/A answer choice, take a look at our blog post here: The N/A Answer Choice: When It’s Good To Use & When It’s Not (English only).

Depending on how you send your survey, you can limit the survey availability period for just one respondent, several respondents, or for everyone that will receive your survey. You may be able to close or schedule an end date from the GetFeedback survey builder, or you can use the gf_expire merge field to add an expiration date to your surveys. Closing a Survey Sent With a Link To close a survey that was sent using a link : From your survey, select Distribute > Survey Link . To immediately stop collecting responses, turn off the toggle next to This link is collecting responses . You'll see the date and time that response collection was turned off. Scheduling a Survey End Date To schedule an end date for a survey that was sent using a link : From your survey, select Distribute > Survey Link . Select Schedule an end date . Choose an end date from the calendar popup. The survey will close at midnight by default. To choose a different time, select the clock icon and customize the time. The time is based on your timezone, not the survey respondent’s. Scheduling an End Date for Individual Surveys Use the gf_expire merge field to schedule an end date. This method works best when you want to schedule an end date for an individual or small group of respondents. You can also add gf_expire as an additional merge field to surveys sent out with our Salesforce Automation and HTML and Pardot email templates. To add gf_expire to your survey link: From your survey, select Distribute > Survey Link . Copy the live link to your survey and paste it in a text editor. Add a question mark ? to the end, then add gf_expire . Add an equals sign = to the end, then enter the date to end the survey on. Many different formats for expiration date and time should work with gf_expire . Using gf_expire with Salesforce When using the gf_expire merge field with Salesforce, your syntax should look like this: SURVEYURL?gf_expire=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ Include the end date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Add the letter T , which comes before the end time. Add the end time in HH:MM:SS format. Add the letter Z , which represents the time zone (UTC). Here’s an example of a formatted link. This link expires at 2:00PM UTC on January 1, 2020. https://www.getfeedback.com/r/SURVEYURL?gf_expire=2020-01-01T14:00:00Z If you’re using additional merge fields , you can add them to your survey link before or after the gf_expire merge field, with an ampersand ( & ) separating them. https://www.getfeedback.com/r/SURVEYURL?gf_expire=2020-01-01T014:00:00Z&AccountName=GetFeedback Learn more about Salesforce datetime formats Closing a Web Overlay Survey Disabling a survey link in the GetFeedback survey builder does not disable an active Web Overlay survey.

In the bottom left of the screen, turn off the toggle next to This website survey is active and will display on your website . Once you turn off the toggle, the label should read This website survey is inactive and will not be displayed on your website .

If a survey was sent without a scheduled end date, contact GetFeedback support to close the survey. Send to a List Before sending your survey via Send To a List , select Schedule an end date at the bottom of the email builder to set an end date. Your survey will turn off on that selected date and won't collect any other survey responses.

Divisions,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/divisions/,"Divisions | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Roles and Permissions Adding and Managing Divisions Managing Division Admins Adding and Managing Users in Divisions Importing Divisions by CSV Help Teams & Enterprise Collaborating With Your Team Divisions SurveyMonkey Divisions Roles and Permissions Adding and Managing Divisions Managing Division Admins Adding and Managing Users in Divisions Importing Divisions by CSV A Division is a sub-group within your Enterprise team, with its own admins, users, and division library . Primary Admins and Admins can add divisions for different departments, offices, clients, cost centers, or any other groups you want to manage separately or give unique branding assets. TIP! Divisions or Workgroups? Divisions help with administrative management of large teams while Workgroups help organize team members collaborating on survey projects. Roles and Permissions Roles Here's a basic overview of the roles for divisions: Seat * Role Description Power Primary Admin The Primary Admin is in charge of billing, library management, and role assignments. Power Admin Admins get most of the same permissions as the Primary Admin, including the ability to manage divisions, libraries, and roles. Power Division Admin The Primary Admin or Admin can add users as Division Admins . Division Admins manage their assigned divisions, people in those divisions, and their division libraries. Power Power User Power Users can create and share surveys using all the Enterprise features and tools. They can be assigned to one division and can create and share surveys using the assets in their library. They don't have permission to manage the team or divisions. Casual* Casual User* Casual Users have access to simple SurveyMonkey features and can create surveys and preview teammates’ work. Enterprise teams have unlimited Casual seats. Like Power Users, they can be assigned to one division and can create and share surveys using the assets in their library. They don't have permission to manage the team or divisions. *Only some Enterprise plans have Power and Casual seats. Permissions Here's what people in each role can do in divisions: Primary Admin or Admin Division Admin * Power and Casual Users Create divisions ✅ ❌ ❌ Add or remove Division Admins ✅ ❌ ❌ Edit division settings ✅ ❌ ❌ Delete divisions ✅ ❌ ❌ Import a CSV spreadsheet to manage users ✅ ❌ ❌ Add assets to the team library ✅ ❌ ❌ See Divisions ✅ ✅ ❌ Add users to a division ✅ ✅ ❌ Transfer users ✅ ✅ ❌ View division Activity ✅ ✅ ❌ View User Report ✅ ✅ ❌ Add assets to division libraries ✅ ✅ ❌ * Division Admins can only manage and view users, info, and library assets in their divisions. Adding and Managing Divisions Primary Admins and Admins can add one division at a time or import a CSV file to add or update multiple divisions at a time. Adding a Division To create a division: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Divisions and Add division . Enter a unique Division name—up to 255 characters. (Optional) Enter a Description , Region , and Cost center . Descriptions can have up to 300 characters and the other fields can have up to 255 characters. Select Add division . Once your division is created, add Division Admins and add users to the division. Adding or Editing Multiple Divisions at a Time Import a CSV file to add new divisions or update existing ones. Editing a Division To edit the division settings: From Divisions , select the division name. Navigate to the SETTINGS tab. Edit the Division name, Description , Region , or Cost center . Descriptions can have up to 300 characters and the other fields can have up to 255 characters. Select Update division . Deleting a Division To delete a division: From Divisions , select the box next to the division(s) you want to delete. Select Delete . After a division is deleted, users that were in that division become available to add to another division. If you decide not to add them to a division, the users still have an account as part of the team. All surveys and data will remain in each user's account. Managing Division Admins TIP! Import users by CSV file to assign Division Admins and add users to divisions all at once. Adding a Division Admin To add a Division Admin: From Divisions , select the division name that you want to add a Division Admin to. Navigate to the ADMINS tab. Select + Add admins . Search and select users. Primary Admins and Admins can't be Division Admins. Select Add Division Admins . When someone is a Division Admin, they can see their divisions from the Divisions tab and add or manage users in their divisions. Someone can be a Division Admin in multiple divisions, and a division can have multiple Division Admins. Removing a Division Admin To remove someone's Division Admin role: From Divisions , select on the division name that you want to remove a Division Admin from. Navigate to the ADMINS tab. Choose the Division Admin(s) to remove. Select Remove from admins . If the Division Admin is also a user in the division, they'll remain a user in the division. If they're also a Division Admin for another division, they'll remain the Division Admin for that division. Notifications When someone is added or removed as a Division Admin, we send them a notification email to their account email address . Adding and Managing Users in Divisions TIP! Import users by CSV file to add or transfer users and assign Division Admins to divisions all at once. Adding Users To add users to a division: From Divisions , select the division name that you want to add users to. Navigate to the USERS tab. Select + Add users . Choose users to add to the division. Select Add Users . Why can’t I add a User? Primary Admins and Admins can add users to any division while Division Admins can only add users to their divisions. Users need to be part of the team before they can be added to a division. Someone can be a user in one division at a time. If you search for a user that you know is part of your team but see No result found , it means the user is already in a different division. Removing or Transferring Users Primary Admins and Admins can transfer users out of a division to remove them, or transfer users to another division. Division Admins can remove users from their division, but can only transfer users to another division if they're also the Division Admin. To transfer users: From Divisions , select the division name. Choose which users to transfer. Select Transfer users . You can either select: Transfer out of division to remove the users. Transfer to another division and then Select a division to transfer the users to. Select Save . Importing Divisions by CSV TIP! You can invite multiple users to your Enterprise team by importing users by CSV. How It Works Import a CSV file to add new divisions or update existing ones. You'll be able to add or manage users in divisions after divisions are set up. Spreadsheet Setup View our example screenshot to see how to properly format your CSV file. Create a spreadsheet in an application like Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets. Make sure you set up your spreadsheet's first row with these header fields: Division name , Description , Region , and Cost center . Follow these guidelines when adding data to your spreadsheet: Descriptions can have up to 300 characters and the other fields can have up to 255 characters The file can have up to 200 rows Division name is required If you're updating existing divisions, make sure the division name on your spreadsheet matches what's in SurveyMonkey, otherwise a new division will be created.

Response Rate,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/response-rate/,"Response Rate | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Solutions SurveyMonkey Audience Panel Response Rate SurveyMonkey Response Rate Your response rate is the percentage of people who respond to your survey. To calculate the response rate percentage for your survey, use the following equation: You can find the total number of responses in the Analyze Results section of your survey. To calculate your response rate based on the number of complete responses to your survey, filter by completeness and select Complete responses . The number of complete responses appears at the top of the page when the filter is applied. TIP! Learn how to calculate the number of respondents you need or use our sample size calculator . Improving Your Response Rate If a large number of respondents don't respond to your survey, or they exit or abandon your survey before completing it, you'll have a low response rate. In general, you can expect a low response rate if your survey is long, your survey language is complicated, or you send your survey to the wrong audience. Read our tips to ensure you're doing all you can to get the best response rate possible. Expand | Collapse Clean Up Your Survey Design The length and tone of your survey dramatically impact your response rate. If survey is long and your questions are text heavy, respondents can feel overwhelmed and exit your survey. Keep these tips in mind when designing your survey: Keep your survey short—include only the essential questions and answer options. Attention and motivation tend to drop as a survey goes on. Use the fewest, shortest words possible to say what you mean. The less respondents have to read, the better. Keep your language simple. Aim for a vocabulary you think a young adult would understand and don't use jargon. Let respondents skip open-ended questions—don't require open-ended questions. Respondents who don't want to take the time to write a response might exit the survey instead of writing a response. Target Your Audience Survey topics may not engage or interest all survey-takers. If someone is uninterested, they may exit your survey and lower your response rate. You can add a qualifying question to your survey to ensure you're surveying the right people. Add Skip Logic to your survey to skip people past questions or pages that may not apply to them. If you're using SurveyMonkey Audience to buy survey responses, read our targeting tips . Keep Contacts Up to Date If you know your survey audience personally, let people know that you're planning to conduct a survey, what it's about, and when to expect it. If you're sending your survey to a list of contacts, either by Email Invitation or through another messaging platform, make sure your contact list is up to date. If your contact list is out of date, you may be missing important contacts whose email addresses have changed, and your messages could bounce. Send Your Survey Multiple Ways If you use more than one collector to distribute your survey, you'll increase your chances of getting responses. In addition to emailing a list of contacts, consider posting a link to your survey in a Listserv, Facebook, LinkedIn, or other web communities. Test Your Survey Test your survey with a smaller group of people before sending it out to your entire contact list. This will help you identify any issues in your survey language or design and give you a general idea of what you can expect to see as an overall response rate from a larger group. Personalize Email Invitations and Send Reminders Make sure your survey invitations are inviting—keep them short, simple, and approachable. Provide a brief introduction about what your survey is about, and how long it will take. If you need to include detailed information, like a privacy notice, consent statement , or survey instructions, include it in a survey introduction instead of your invitation. If you're sending your survey via Email Invitation , personalize invitations and reminders by including the name of your respondents using custom data tags in your message.

How to Move Applications to Trash,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/trash-app/,"How to Move Applications to Trash | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Move Applications to Trash Viewing Trashed Applications Restoring Trashed Applications How to Permanently Delete Applications How Does Changing Live Data Affect Trashed Applications? Help Monitor Manage Applications How to Move Applications to Trash Apply How to Move Applications to Trash How to Move Applications to Trash Viewing Trashed Applications Restoring Trashed Applications How to Permanently Delete Applications How Does Changing Live Data Affect Trashed Applications? If you wish to store applications within your SurveyMonkey Apply site for future reporting, you may do so by either archiving or deleting these applications. This article discusses how to safely move your applications to Trash within your site. Archiving Applications vs. Moving to Trash The key difference between the two options is mainly for organizational purposes. In most cases, Archived Applications refer to applications that have gone through the most if not all of the application process in a previous year or cycle. They allow you to organize that those applications were real applications that passed through your process. Trashed Applications, however, are typically applications that are incomplete, or were used for testing. Applications are most commonly moved to trash when: The application was created in error To separate test applications from your live data The applicant did not complete the application after it was created How to Move Applications to Trash Moving an application to trash will store unnecessary applications within a trashed folder helping you to separate test applications and applications made in error from your active applications. To trash an application from Manage Applications: Go to Manage Applications . Select applications to move to trash. Select More . Select Move to Trash . If an application is moved to trash in error the action can be reverted. See Restoring Trashed Applications below for steps to recover these applications. Viewing Trashed Applications Aggregate and filter through all archived or trashed applications to find information or restore applications to an active status. To view all trashed applications: Go to Manage Applications Update the filter drop-down menu to Trashed applications. To see material within the trashed application, select the application title to enter the administrator application view . Restoring Trashed Applications If an application is moved to the trash in error, the application can be reactivated ultimately reverting the error. To restore a trashed application: Go to Manage Applications . Access your trashed applications from the status filter drop-down menu. Select applications that need their status reverted. Select More . Select Restore. How to Permanently Delete Applications Applications can only be permanently deleted from a site if they are first marked as trash. For this reason, the action of permanently deleting an application can only be carried out from the trashed applications page within Manage Applications. This action cannot be reverted. Permanently deleting an application will remove it indefinitely from your site and you will no longer be able to retrieve the application. To permanently delete an application: Go to Manage Applications . Access your trashed applications from the status filter drop-down menu. Select the applications that need to be permanently deleted. Select More . Select Delete Permanently . You will be provided with the warning ""Are you sure you want to permanently delete the selected applications?"" Click YES to confirm your deletion. How Does Changing Live Data Affect Trashed Applications? Changes to your workflow may affect archived and trashed applications. For example, if you delete a question from a form, the answers to that question will be deleted from all applications using that form. This would include all active and inactive applications (archived, trashed, and withdrawn). Additionally, when a task is deleted from your workflow, the information captured by that task will also be deleted from any archived or trashed applications.

Google Add-Ons,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/integrations/google-add-ons/,"Google Add-Ons | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Google Sheets Add-On Google Forms Add-On Linking and Unlinking Your Accounts Help Integrations Sync & Analyze Data Google Add-Ons SurveyMonkey Google Add-Ons Google Sheets Add-On Google Forms Add-On Linking and Unlinking Your Accounts Limitation: The Google add-on setup is only available in English. We have two Google add-ons available: Use the SurveyMonkey for Google Sheets add-on to import your survey results directly into Google Sheets. Use the SurveyMonkey for Google Forms add-on to import your form into a SurveyMonkey survey. Google Sheets Add-On This add-on is available for SurveyMonkey paid plans . The Google Sheets add-on lets you import your survey responses to a spreadsheet. We’ll update your spreadsheets with new responses until you choose to stop importing. To import your survey results to Google Sheets: Get the free SurveyMonkey for Google Sheets add-on . You can find it in the SurveyMonkey App Directory or the Google Workspace Marketplace. Create a new spreadsheet in your Google account. Click Extensions from the toolbar. Select the SurveyMonkey add-on, then select Open . Select Get Started to log in with your SurveyMonkey details to authorize and open the app. The login page opens in a new browser tab. Once you log in, go back to your spreadsheet. Start Syncing Responses Once you sign in, you can start importing responses from SurveyMonkey. To import responses: Once your survey list pops up, select the survey you want to import results from. Check the boxes for the collectors you want to import results from. A green dot means the collector is open, and a gray dot means it's closed. Click Start importing to import the survey data. We create a new sheet with the same name as the survey you’re importing. We’ll also update your sheet with new responses any time you open the SurveyMonkey add-on. TIP! It’s best to stop importing responses before making changes to your spreadsheet. Spreadsheet Organization The add-on imports all responses from the collectors you selected into a sheet with the exact same name as the survey. The following information will help you get started analyzing the spreadsheet: Row 1 contains the question text from the survey. When a question isn't answered or is skipped by logic, the text ""Not Answered"" displays in the cell. The Checkbox question type lists each answer choice as it's own column and assigns True if the answer option was selected or False if it wasn’t. Questions with multiple rows, columns, or fields of answer choices span across multiple columns in the spreadsheet with each row, column, or field in its own column. The spreadsheet organizes respondents by row and includes the time the survey was submitted or last modified and the complete answer set for each respondent. For additional respondent metadata you may have included in an Email Invitation Collector, please download an All Responses Data XLS export . Filtering Your Spreadsheet You can create filters in Google Sheets to organize the results, but it's best to wait to edit the spreadsheet until you're done refreshing the results—refreshing may overwrite changes you've made to the sheet. Refreshing Your Data To refresh the available surveys or response counts per collector, click the refresh button at the top of the list to the right of your SurveyMonkey username. To import new responses to the sheet, close and reopen the SurveyMonkey add-on. We’ll update your spreadsheet with new responses. We can only import responses into a sheet (or tab) that has the same name as the survey you’re importing. If the name of the sheet or survey changes, we’ll import responses to a new sheet. Importing Data to a New Sheet You can import the survey data into a new sheet (or tab) within the spreadsheet if you don't want to overwrite any changes you've made. You have two options: Edit the name of the sheet (the tab within the spreadsheet—not the name of the spreadsheet itself), then click Import to the right of the survey title. A new sheet will be created within the spreadsheet. Edit the survey title in SurveyMonkey, then click Import to the right of the survey title. A new sheet will be created with the updated survey title. Stop Importing Responses Stop importing responses to change which collectors you import responses from or make changes to your sheet. To stop importing new responses: From the SurveyMonkey extension, select the survey you want to stop importing responses from. Click Stop importing to the right of the survey title. If you want to keep importing responses later, just select Start importing . If you start importing again, any changes made to the spreadsheet will be lost. To keep any changes you made, rename your tab before you start importing responses again. Limitations Google Sheets allows us to import up to 3,000 responses at a time. To view more responses in a sheet, consider exporting your results to an XLS or CSV file. If your survey has a lot of questions or responses, please refer to Google's spreadsheet size limits . We support the new version of Google Sheets, which has a limit of 2 million cells per spreadsheet. A/B Test responses can’t be imported. Google Forms Add-On This add-on is available for all SurveyMonkey plan types, including the free plan. The Google Forms add-on lets you convert a Google Form to a survey in SurveyMonkey. You can then design and send your survey from SurveyMonkey. To import your Google Form into a survey: Get the free SurveyMonkey for Google Forms add-on . Open your Google Form. Click Add-ons from the toolbar. Open the SurveyMonkey add-on. You'll need to log in with your SurveyMonkey details to authorize and open the app. Once the app window pops up, select the form questions you want to include in your survey. Questions that are greyed out can't be imported. Click Convert to Survey . Log in to SurveyMonkey to finish designing your survey . Linking and Unlinking Your Accounts Your Google account can only be linked with one SurveyMonkey account at a time. To switch the SurveyMonkey account you're using in the add-on: Click Sign Out from the bottom of the SurveyMonkey app window. Click Get Started within that same window. On the authorization page, click Use Another Account and log in. To unlink your accounts entirely: Go to your SurveyMonkey My Account page . In the Linked Accounts section, click Unlink next to the Google Sheets or Google Forms application. Go to your Google My Account page .

Automations: Overview,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/automation-overview/,"Automations: Overview | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Understanding the structure of Automations Overview Stage Automations Program Automations Common Use Cases Help Build Automations Automations: Overview Apply Automations: Overview Understanding the structure of Automations Overview Stage Automations Program Automations Common Use Cases Automations can be configured to perform actions based on the activity of applications, completion of assignments, date activations, and many other actions within the site. This article provides an overview of automations including how to build, manage, and troubleshoot automations within your site. Understanding the structure of Automations Creating and understanding automations can be done by thinking about the logic of what you want to achieve. Every automation can be read as a sentence: WHEN this occurs, IF this has been met, DO this So for example, if you wish to move applications after it has been reviewed, our sentence would be: WHEN the application has been reviewed, IF it has a score lower than 10, MOVE to next stage For every automation, the Activation and Action sections are required , however, the Conditions (IF statement) are optional. If there is no condition the automation will fire for all applications. Another example would be: WHEN the application has been submitted, MOVE to next stage and EMAIL applicant Overview There are two areas where automations are managed: within a stage, and within Automations of a Program accessed while in Build Mode. The table below provides a description of the settings and features used to configure an automation. Settings Descriptions Title The name of the automation as it appears throughout the site. Folder The folder associated with the automation. Folders are used to help organize automations for the programs within your site. A folder is limited to appearing within the program where it was created and will not appear in any other program within your site. Advanced Settings Select Show Advanced Settings to reveal Limit, Priority, and Delay settings that the automation will follow. Limit Set the limit for the maximum number of times the automation can fire for a specific application. Priority Set a priority for the automation so that if another automation fires off of the same activation, one of the automations will always fire before or after the other. If a priority is used, it should be enabled and set for all automations using that same activation. Delay Enable this option to delay the action from occurring if the activation and rules have been set. Hours and Days are available as intervals to create the delay. WHEN TO APPLY Referred to as the WHEN statement, this refers to when the automation will fire if all rules have been met. Source: The source of the event. Event: The activation that will cause the automation to fire if the rules are met. For example the completion of a task, the creation of an application, when a review is completed, etc. Target: Will appear if the source refers to a specific task. Targets the specific task that will prompt the automation to fire. CONDITIONS Referred to as the Conditions, rules listed here will determine if the automation will fire when the activation has been triggered. There are two types of matching criteria: ALL: all rules listed must be met in order for the automation to fire ANY: one or more rules must be met for the automation to fire Actions: - Add a new rule - Remove an existing rule - Nest rules together to use a combination of the ALL or ANY matching criteria DO the following Actions The actions that will be performed if the activation is triggered and all/any of the rules have been met based on the configuration of the Condition for the automation. Icons within the DO statement: (Up and down arrows) Adjust the order the actions will follow (X) Remove an action (+) Add a new action View Log Select to enter a log of when the automation has fired and for which applications. Status (Inactive/Active) Automations will only fire if they are Active. Prior to Saving the Form, enable the automation to be Active to ensure the automation fires correctly. Stage Automations Stage Automations are configured from the stage settings from the Stage Automations tab and always consist of a rule or activation that reference a specific stage within the program workflow. Only automations with a condition or activation of ""application is in stage"" can be managed here. The Stage Automations page will only display automations that reference the stage being viewed. To access the automations of a specific stage: Go to the Workflow Select the stage that is associated with the new automation Select the Stage Automations tab From the Stage Automations tab, select one of the templates to get you started OR select Create Automations Create a title for your automation Optional: Select an existing folder or create a new folder to organize your automation To set a limit, priority, or delay select Advanced Settings and enable as required Set the When statement for the automation and select Set Activation when finished Optional: Select additional Conditions or rules that must be met for the automation to fire and perform given actions. Select the Do statements or actions that the automation will perform. Activate your automation Select Save NOTE: When configuring the Conditions the ""application is in stage"" rule will automatically be populated. This cannot be edited until after the automation has been created. Program Automations Program Automations are configured from the Automations tab displayed while in edit mode. To create an automation from the Program Automations page: Enter Edit Mode for that program Select the Automations tab Select Create Automation Add a title to your automation Optional: Add the automation to a Folder Optional: Enable Advanced Settings Set WHEN, IF, and DO Statements Activate your automation Select Save Common Use Cases A few common use cases for automations are: Hiding and Showing Tasks Applying Labels Moving Applications between Stages Submitting an Application Archiving Applications Applying Custom Fields Sending Emails How to Automatically Submit an Application Once Recommendation Task is Complete Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Audience Credits,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/audience-credits/,"Audience Credits | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Buying Audience Credits Using Credits to Buy Responses Your Credit Balance and Transaction History Managing Budgets on Enterprise Enterprise Teams without Budgets Help Payments & Billing Payment Methods Solutions SurveyMonkey Audience Panel Audience Credits SurveyMonkey Audience Credits Buying Audience Credits Using Credits to Buy Responses Your Credit Balance and Transaction History Managing Budgets on Enterprise Enterprise Teams without Budgets Audience Credits let you pay for your SurveyMonkey Audience responses in advance. This is great if you’ve got a set budget allotted for your survey projects since you pay one invoice upfront, then use credits to pay for individual projects. You can also use credits to pay for SurveyMonkey Audience responses when using Market Research Solutions . You can buy credits in all supported currencies , and must be used within 1 year from the date of purchase. Buying Audience Credits How to Buy Credits To buy Audience Credits: Log in to your SurveyMonkey account and click your username in the upper-right corner. Select My Account from the drop-down menu. Click the Transaction History tab. Click the Add Credits button and enter the amount you want to buy (whole numbers only). Then fill out your billing details. Review your order details and click Confirm to create the invoice you’ll need to pay. Open the invoice and click Pay Now . All the details on how to pay and where to send payments is right there on the invoice. TIP! Once your payment is processed , you can start using credits to pay for responses. If you want to use them right away, click Pay Now on your invoice and pay by credit or debit card. Taxes on Audience Credits Purchases Depending on your billing country, taxes may be included when you pay the invoice for your Audience Credits. You won’t pay taxes again when you use credits to buy responses—in other words, taxes aren’t included when you use credits to pay for responses since you already paid taxes when you bought the credits, when applicable. Invoices with VAT included must be paid within 45 days otherwise the invoice is voided. Using Credits to Buy Responses How to Use Credits Once you have your survey ready to go, and you're ready to launch your Audience project, you can use your existing credit balance to pay for responses. To use Audience credits to buy responses : Go to the Collect Responses section of the survey you're buying responses for. Choose Buy Responses and set up your Targeted Audience Collector . When you’re ready, click Proceed to Checkout . Under Payment Method , select My Credits and Confirm .

Select Target your ideal respondents and set up your Target Audience Collector . When you’re ready, click Checkout. Under Payment Method , select My Credits and click Confirm . Don't have enough credits? You can’t use credits as a partial payment—to use credits, you need enough to cover the total amount. If you don't have enough credits to cover the full cost, you have two options: Add credits to your account so you can make a full payment using your credit balance. You can click Add Credits from the checkout window, then buy credits . Once your payment is processed, you can go back to your Audience collector to complete the payment with credits. All your settings in the collector are saved for you so you can pick up where you left off. Pay for your responses with a credit or debit card instead of using credits. Your Credit Balance and Transaction History Your credit balance is the total number of credits currently available to you to buy Audience responses. You can find your credit balance in your Transaction History . To access your transaction history: Log in to your SurveyMonkey account. Click your username in the upper-right corner. Click My Account from the drop-down menu. Click the Transaction History tab. From your Transaction History, you can view and print your Audience Credit Activity and your Purchase History with a record of all upcoming and past invoices. If you have an invoice you need to pay, click Pay Now . All the payment method and bank info you need to make your payment is right on the invoice. Managing Budgets on Enterprise ENTERPRISE ADD-ON: If you're interested, contact sales . Budgets are an easy, manageable way for Admins to buy targeted SurveyMonkey Audience responses, and share them with a team of selected members.

Click the More icon ( ... ) to the right of the budget you'd like to delete. Review the information shown about the budget. Click Delete .

On Enterprise teams, the Primary Admin can restrict users from buying responses in Enterprise Settings . Users request credits, and the Primary Admin transfers them to their account. Expand | Collapse Transfer Credits Primary Admins on Enterprise teams can purchase and transfer credits from the Manage Credits page. To transfer credits from one user on your team to another: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Manage Credits . Find the user you want to transfer credits to and click +.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Web Link Encryption,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/integrations/salesforce-link-encryption/,"SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Web Link Encryption | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Before you Start Map Your Survey to Salesforce Create a Salesforce Web Link Collector Turn on Encryption and Copy Link Get an Encryption Key Set up Encryption in Salesforce Send your Survey Help Integrations Automate Tasks SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Web Link Encryption SurveyMonkey SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Web Link Encryption Before you Start Map Your Survey to Salesforce Create a Salesforce Web Link Collector Turn on Encryption and Copy Link Get an Encryption Key Set up Encryption in Salesforce Send your Survey Get the integration! SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). The integration setup is only available in English. If you’re sending a web link from the Salesforce integration , you can encrypt custom variables. Encryption protects user data by preventing respondents from seeing or editing the custom variables in your web link. Need more help with the Salesforce integration? Check out our Getting Started guide >> There are a few steps you need to take to set up encryption: Map your survey to Salesforce Create a web link collector in the Salesforce integration Turn on encryption Get an encryption key from your Primary Admin (this may be you) Set up encryption in Salesforce (we’ll provide instructions below) Send your survey Read these instructions to get started. Work with a Salesforce administrator to complete these steps, if possible - you may need to build custom code for your environment. SurveyMonkey’s support team can’t consult on coding issues in Salesforce. Before you Start Reach out to your Customer Success Manager to get the Encryption feature enabled. You’ll only need to get it enabled once. Map Your Survey to Salesforce Create your survey mappings. You can use our managed package or create your own mappings to standard and custom Salesforce objects. Learn how >> Create a Salesforce Web Link Collector Create a web link collector in the Salesforce integration. Make sure to add any custom variables you’d like to collect from your respondents. Learn how >> Turn on Encryption and Copy Link Once you’ve created your web link, toggle on the option to Encrypt custom variables . We’ll show you an encrypted version of your survey link to send. However, this link won’t work until you set up encryption in Salesforce. You’ll see instructions to set up encryption and a code sample. Copy this code sample to use later. You can always come back to this page and copy it later. Get an Encryption Key from your Primary Admin Ask your Primary Admin to create an encryption key and provide it to you. To generate an encryption key: As a Primary Admin, go to the header and select My Team > Settings . Select Encryption key for Salesforce at the bottom of the page (you may need to scroll). Select Generate key . Copy the key and provide it to the person setting up encryption in Salesforce. They’ll add this key to the encryption code in Salesforce. Make sure to store the key somewhere safe – we won’t show it again once you leave the encryption key page. If you lose this key, the Primary Admin can generate a new one later. Set up Encryption in Salesforce To set up encryption in Salesforce: From the web link collector page in the Salesforce integration, copy the code sample. This is the encryption code you’ll use in Salesforce. In Salesforce, create a custom field called SM_CV_ENCRYPTED_Data on the object that triggers your survey. For example, if your survey is sent when a Case is closed, place this custom field on the Case object. Make sure your encryption code references and places encrypted values in this field. In Salesforce , create an apex trigger that encrypts your custom variables when the event that triggers your survey occurs (for example, if your survey is sent when a Case is closed, make sure your trigger encrypts custom variables when this event happens). Or, paste the code sample from the Salesforce integration page and replace SM_ENCRYPTION_KEY with the encryption key your Primary Admin provided. IMPORTANT! If you want to use the code sample we provide, read the information on using the code below. Considerations For Using Sample Code We provide sample code for this trigger when you turn on encryption. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using this code: Make sure to review the trigger and update it for your environment as needed. For example, you may want to update the trigger for the survey. This code only references the object you map your survey to (for example, if you map your survey to the Case object and then add mappings to the Account object, the sample code will only reference the Case object). If you map your survey to multiple objects, you’ll need to write custom code or update the sample to meet your needs. This code places encrypted data in the SM_CV_ENCRYPTED_Data field on your object. If you don’t have a field with this name on your object, the code won’t work. Send your Survey Set up any automations you need to send your survey link. If you’re sending this link from Salesforce, you’ll want to create an email template with your link, set up an email alert, and create a flow to send your survey.

As you build your survey, follow these guidelines to make sure your order is a success. You should also read SurveyMonkey Audience Policies to check that your survey complies with our Acceptable Uses Policy . Survey Requirements Your survey must meet the following requirements and follow our Terms of Service in order to buy responses through SurveyMonkey Audience . If your survey doesn't meet these requirements, you'll need to fix your survey design before you can buy responses. Expand | Collapse Require at least one question Make at least one question required . Requiring a question ensures survey-takers answer the question and move on in the survey. Ask fewer than 80 questions Your survey can't have more than 80 questions, but we do recommend using less than 50 questions. Research shows that long surveys cause satisficing —when survey-takers speed through surveys just to get to the end. Every question type counts as one question, except Matrix/Rating Scale questions, Matrix of Dropdown Menu questions, text elements, and image elements. Each row in Matrix/Rating Scale or Matrix of Dropdown Menu question counts as one question. Text and Image elements don't count towards the 80 question limit. Don't add a quota Adding a quota to your survey design can prevent you from getting the completed responses you purchased. Instead of adding a quota, use multiple Audience collectors to reach the sampling you need. Check Skip Logic paths When using Skip Logic or Advanced Branching , there are a few things to keep in mind: Make sure that you move survey-takers forward through your survey—don’t send people back to a previous page. This could prevent them from completing your survey. Add page breaks between each piece of logic. Logic is triggered when people click the Next button on a survey page. Check whether you have both page and question logic applied on the same page. Question logic overrides page logic, and Advanced Branching rules work a bit differently. If you use screening questions, make sure to skip people to a Disqualification Page . Avoid sending people to the End of Survey as these responses will count towards your complete responses. You can test your survey logic when you preview your survey to make sure everything's working as expected. Choose the right survey language If you're buying global responses, your survey needs to be in one of the supported languages for the country you're targeting. Don't ask for contact or personal information Collecting personal info, like names, emails, phone numbers, other contact details, sensitive information, or other personally identifiable information isn’t allowed, per our Terms of Service . Don't add File Upload questions To avoid collecting personal information, you can't add a File Upload question to a survey sent through a Target Audience collector. Don't add links or ask people to leave your survey The survey needs to follow our Acceptable Uses Policy . You can't link out to external websites. If you need to show survey-takers additional context, add images or videos to your survey design. Don't edit your survey after you checkout Editing the survey design after you buy responses can cause issues for survey-takers and cause inconsistencies in your survey results. When a live survey is edited, survey-takers are looped back to the start of the survey, and their results may not match the results of your original survey. The SurveyMonkey team cannot be held liable if a survey performs in unintended ways after the design has been edited, per our Terms of Use . Don't ask minors to participate in your survey Our services are not intended for use by minors. As per our Terms of Use and Acceptable Uses Policy they are prohibited from taking part in surveys. Survey Requirement Error Messages You may see an error message if your survey doesn’t meet our requirements. Please follow the instructions to edit your survey to meet these requirements and send your survey through SurveyMonkey Audience. Recommended Best Practices While these guidelines aren't required, we've found that surveys that follow them are more likely to be engaging and get higher response rates. Expand | Collapse Establish a clear goal for your survey A survey with one survey goal and only a few subtopics can streamline the survey creation process and simplify the analysis phase. Limit Matrix/Rating Scale, Ranking, and open-ended questions We suggest using a variety of question types , but avoid using too many open-ended questions like Textboxes and Comment Boxes . Limit open-ended questions to 3-5 per survey. Avoid Ranking questions, and limit the use of Matrix/Rating Scale and Matrix of Dropdown Menu questions. If you do use Matrix questions, use a maximum of 5 Matrix questions per survey with no more than 5 columns and 5 rows per question. Consider breaking matrix rows into individual Multiple Choice questions. Each row in Matrix/Rating Scale or Matrix of Dropdown Menu question counts as one question. Avoid using Click Map questions Using Click Map questions limits the number of panelists you're able to reach. Consider using other question types to maximize response rates. Create a short, simple survey Use fewer than 10 survey pages with no more than 10 questions per page. Short, simple surveys sent through SurveyMonkey Audience have higher response rates. Split long survey pages into multiple pages with fewer than 10 questions to help avoid survey fatigue. Also, grouping questions by theme or topic can help survey-takers focus their thoughts and quickly proceed through your survey. Write short introductions and consent statements If you're including a survey introduction or consent form , limit it to 500 characters or less. Keep videos short Don't include more than one video in your survey, and aim to keep it under 90 seconds. Longer videos can cause survey-takers to drop out, or simply skip the video and answer the questions without watching it. Preview your images Images are a great way to provide examples or A/B test different concepts. When adding images to your survey, check the sizing by previewing your survey at desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions on different browsers. Add ""Other"" as an answer option To ensure survey-takers aren't forced to select an inaccurate answer choice, include "" Other "" as an answer choice. Make sure to display the ""Other"" option as an answer choice (rather than a comment field). Avoid too many answer choice options Multiple Choice or Checkbox questions should have a maximum of 10 answer choices. If you do offer more than 10 answer choices, change the layout to display answer choices in multiple columns so the question isn’t intimidating for respondents. Hide asterisks, titles, and progress bars You can update the design options to hide asterisks from required questions, hide the survey title and page titles, and hide the progress bar. Hiding these design options reduces bias and discourages speeding or satisficing through a survey. Turn off One Question at a Time Disable the One Question at a Time survey format. Use screening questions or disqualifying questions You can add screening questions to your survey to narrow down your target audience and skip survey-takers to a disqualification page if they don't match your desired audience. It's okay to ask disqualified survey-takers additional questions before you send them out of the survey to learn more about them. Gathering data about why someone doesn't use a product can be just as useful as knowing why they do. Include demographic questions so you can filter your results Before sending your survey, think about how you want to analyze your data and filter your results . SurveyMonkey Audience includes general demographic info for each survey-taker in your survey results. If you need other demographic info about your survey-takers, ask these questions in your survey. Consider adding pre-written questions to your survey from the Demographics category of our Question Bank . Or try browsing the Market Research, Brand Research, Consumer Research, Design Feedback, and Purchase Intent categories to get inspired. Preview and test your survey Preview your survey to make sure everything looks good and your logic works properly. You can toggle between desktop, tablet, and phone to see how your survey looks on various devices. You can even send a preview of your survey to a friend or colleague to get feedback. Not previewing and testing your survey can result in your survey performing in unintended ways. The SurveyMonkey team cannot be held liable if a survey performs in unintended ways, per our Terms of Use . Avoid using Block Randomization SurveyMonkey Rewards doesn’t support Block randomization , so we don’t recommend using it in surveys when buying responses through SurveyMonkey Audience. Maintaining Confidentiality Testing new concepts or ideas that you want to keep private? While we can't guarantee that survey-takers won't share info from your survey, follow these guidelines to make sure that information from your survey can't be traced back to your brand. Expand | Collapse Remove direct references to your brand Avoid including your company's logo, motto, website, brand messaging, product images, or anything else that would allow survey-takers to identify your brand or trace the survey back to your company. If you're testing new designs or concepts, you might consider using a fake brand name for the sake of testing. This lets you receive feedback on new visual assets while keeping your company name private. Disqualify people who might be competitors Add a screening question to the beginning of your survey that asks people to select their industry or job function. Add question skip logic to disqualify survey-takers who might work for competitors to your company. You'll be able to focus more on the opinions of your target audience. Avoid including a confidentiality statement When you tell survey-takers that your survey contains confidential information, they may be more tempted to capture the information they see in the survey and share it with others Related Articles SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings Feature Importance (MaxDiff) Using SurveyMonkey for Market Research English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Carry Forward Responses,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/carry-forward/,"Carry Forward Responses | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Creating Surveys Applying Logic Carry Forward Responses SurveyMonkey Carry Forward Responses Carry Forward Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free Carry Forward Responses allows you to funnel multiple answer choices from one question to another based on respondents' selections. You can choose to carry forward all the answers that the respondent selected, or all the answers that the respondent did not select. This feature allows you to proceed from broader questions to specific questions that are more relevant to the respondent, and more useful to your research. Video Overview Adding Carry Forward Responses Adding Carry Forward Responses requires that you add a sender question, and a receiver question on a later page. Carry Forward Responses logic is activated when the respondent clicks Next to go to the next page, so a receiver question can't be on the same page as the associated sender question. Expand | Collapse Sender Question Types The following question types can send answer choices to a receiver question on a later page in the survey: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Matrix/Rating Scale Dropdown Receiver Question Types The following question types can receive answer choices from a sender question on a previous page in the survey: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Matrix/Rating Scale Dropdown Ranking Multiple Textboxes It isn't possible to apply Carry Forward logic to questions within blocks using Block Randomization . To carry forward previous answer choices into a receiver question: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Click the receiver question you want to edit. Select Use previous answer choices . Make sure you've added a sender question on a previous page (see list above). From the dropdown menu, choose the question whose answers you want to carry forward into the current question. Choose whether you'd like to carry forward responses Selected by respondent or Unselected by respondent . Click Save . The responses that are carried forward are appended after the existing answer choices. To hide an answer choice from the receiver question, click d next to the answer choice. Regardless of how a respondent answers the sender question, answer choices that you hide will not be shown to respondents. Example Here's an example of how you can use Carry Forward Responses to ask follow-up questions about choices survey-takers made: Page 1, Q1: Create a Checkboxes question to ask people which ice cream brands they have purchased. Page 2, Q2: Create a Multiple Choice question, and carry forward the answer choices that the survey-taker selected in Q1. Ask people, of the brands they answered they've previously purchased, which was their favorite. Page 2, Q3: Create a Multiple Textboxes question, and carry forward the answer choices that they did not select. Ask survey-takers to explain why they haven't purchased each brand. Live Preview When you add Carry Forward Responses logic, arrows appear in the Design Survey section, but they won't be visible to respondents taking the survey: Arrows appear next to the sender question to indicate that a question later in the survey carries its answer choices forward. In the receiver question, arrows indicate which answer choices are carried forward from a previous question. Avoid moving questions that have Carry Forward Responses logic applied. Moving questions can cause unexpected behavior. Narrow Based on Answer Column (Matrix/Rating Scale) When you carry forward responses from a Matrix/Rating Scale question, you have the additional option to narrow the choices based on column choices. For example, say the sender question asks respondents to evaluate each row choice on a scale of Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. You can narrow down which row choices are carried forward, based on the respondent's column choice. Usually, column choices represent a rating or evaluation. Here's an example of how you could configure the receiver question: If you choose Selected by respondent and Strongly Agree , only the row choices where the respondent selected ""Strongly Agree"" are carried forward. If you choose Unselected by respondent and Strongly Agree , the respondent's answer choice will only be carried forward if they leave ""Strongly Agree"" unselected. While you can narrow which row choices are carried forward based on column choice selections, you can't carry forward column choices themselves. Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. The survey will gracefully handle receiver questions that don't have any answer choices. If a receiver question has no answer choices to receive, and no answer choices of its own, it's hidden from respondents. If an empty receiver question is the only question on a page, the survey automatically skips past the empty page. Analyzing Results Carried forward responses are treated the same as other answer choices in the Analyze Results section of your survey. All answer choices that are carried forward into receiver questions are included in charts, data tables, and exports. You can also create rules based on answer choices that were carried forward.

Survey Takers Can’t Complete My Survey,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/survey-completion-issue/,"Survey Takers Can’t Complete My Survey | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Common Issues Help Sending Surveys Collecting Responses Survey Takers Can’t Complete My Survey SurveyMonkey Survey Takers Can’t Complete My Survey Common Issues First, make sure the survey link you sent out is correct. Links are character and case sensitive, so an extra space or a lower-case letter in place of an upper-case letter could break the link. If you're using a Web Link Collector, click its nickname from the Collect Responses section of your survey—the correct link is at the top of the page. If you're using an Email Invitation Collector, the correct unique link is sent automatically when you send the message. Common Issues Expand | Collapse Survey takers can't access my survey Per our company policy, our services are not available in the following countries and regions (collectively, the “Prohibited Jurisdictions”): Cuba North Korea Iran Sudan Syria Crimea region The Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions of Ukraine Russia Belarus Respondents attempting to access surveys from a Prohibited Jurisdiction will be blocked and receive an error message. Even if you and your organization are not located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction, you will not be able to collect responses from individuals located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction. For example, an organization in the UK can't get responses from individuals in Syria. Survey takers are asked to log in to SurveyMonkey Check to see if your collector has Multiple Responses turned on or off. If you only allow one response per computer, survey takers might be sent to a SurveyMonkey webpage if they try to access your survey again. This page thanks them for taking the survey and provides information about our site. If they click a link to create a survey or take a SurveyMonkey Contribute survey, they may be asked to log in to SurveyMonkey. Survey takers see a different survey, not mine If survey takers mention anything about being asked how much soda they drink, how often they watch TV, or their income levels or political leanings, then they probably clicked on a link for our Contribute program. Survey takers can see the Contribute ad in the following situations: Your collector has Multiple Responses turned off and the survey taker already took your survey. A survey taker is forwarded a link from someone else's email invitation—Email Invitation Collectors can only record one response per email address. You can edit the Survey End Page to redirect survey taker to any URL after completing the survey. This prevents survey takers from being sent to our Contribute page. You can create a Custom Thank You so survey takers know when your survey is done. Survey takers can't move forward in the survey If you included Skip Logic in your survey design, there may be logic on a question or page that is directing survey takers backwards in the survey. You'll need to edit your survey design to fix the problem. Be sure to only skip survey takers forward in a survey or it can create an endless loop. After you edit the design of a live survey , survey takers taking your survey at that time may be looped back to the start as your survey refreshes. However, survey takers will just need to click the link you already sent to access the updated survey. The URL doesn't change, so you don't need to send a new link. Survey takers see a message saying the survey is closed Check to see if you turned on Cutoff Date and Time or Response Limits . If the date has passed or the response count has been reached, survey takers won't be able to access your survey. You can edit the closed message or turn these settings off. Survey takers see a message saying they've already taken the survey Check to see if you have Multiple Responses turned on or off. It's possible some survey takers are using the same computer to complete the survey. You need to turn on Multiple Responses to account for this. Check to see if have Response Editing on or off. It's possible the survey taker already submitted a survey and is trying to make edits. If you used Email Invitation, survey takers may be forwarded a link from someone else. Email Invitation Collectors can only record one response per email address, so you need to add new recipients. If you make edits to a collector, survey takers just need to click the link you already sent to access the survey. The URL doesn't change, so you don't need to send a new link.

How to Add SAML Details,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/saml-details/,"How to Add SAML Details | Apply Help Log in Apply Help Advanced Features How to Add SAML Details Apply How to Add SAML Details The instructions below focus on the steps necessary for setting up an SAML integration within SurveyMonkey Apply. Please note that an SAML integration also requires setup/configuration of the IdP on the client’s side. To be compliant with our requirements, email is required in the payload. To begin setup: Go to Settings Click on Registration . Scroll down to the bottom. This will bring you into the SSO configuration page on the SM Apply end. There are four Sign-on provider options in the dropdown, facilitating different SSO integration options. The default option is for SAML. The first step is to obtain SM Apply’s SAML metadata found under Service Provider Metadata URL : The Service Provider Metadata URL can be copied and pasted for you to view the metadata. This metadata is to be saved and copied into your IdP server. When configuring this metadata in your IdP, please ensure you have set it up to automatically consume SM Apply metadata. The next step is to complete the required configuration of your IdP. Once the setup/configuration has been completed on the IdP end, the next step is to return to SM Apply to complete the integration. To do this: Navigate to the Settings tab Click on the Registration option Click Enable Single Sign On You will be able to input SAML details here In order to complete/save the integration, the following fields are required: Friendly Name, Entity ID, and Metadata. Additional explanations for the fields are as follows: Friendly Name: Provide a title for this SAML integration. This name will be shown to your users. Service Provider Metadata URL: URL to access Apply metadata for the site (does not need to be changed) Entity ID: The globally unique name for your SAML entity. This can usually be found in your IdP metadata. Unique user identifier name: This field is optional and defaults to SAML Subject ID. If you use a custom ID to uniquely identify users, enter the field here. This should be a static value. Metadata: Place the entirety of your IdP metadata’s <EntityDescriptor> tag. The final option in the integration is Attribute Mapping . This is where additional user attributes from the IdP can be mapped to fields in SM Apply upon a user successfully signing in through the SAML. By default, SM Apply will look for common names for attributes such as first name, last name, and email. If your IdP uses non-standard attribute names, those can be entered here. Common names include: givenName, cn, sn, mail, emailAddress, email. The attribute name is where to insert the name of the attribute as it appears in your metadata. The Destination is a dropdown list of all available fields for those attributes being passed from your IdP to be mapped in SM Apply. The destination has default fields of First Name , Last Name , and Full Name. These fields map to the user’s information in the destination user accounts. Additional attributes can be pulled into SM Apply. To set this up you will need to add Custom Fields in Apply. This can be done by: Click on the Settings tab Select Custom Fields To add in fields, select New Field in the top right of the page On the Create Custom Field page, ensure to set the target to Applicants For more information in regards to Custom Fields please refer to How to Create a Custom Field . Once you have created the custom field, it will appear in the Destination dropdown of the SSO SAML configuration. To be compliant with our requirements, email is required in the payload.

Salesforce Custom Mapping,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-custom-mapping/,"Salesforce Custom Mapping | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Video Before You Start (optional) Setting Up Custom Objects in Salesforce Building Custom Mappings in GetFeedback Mapping Custom Values to Salesforce Custom Mapping Types Help Salesforce Salesforce Custom Mapping GetFeedback Salesforce Custom Mapping Video Before You Start (optional) Setting Up Custom Objects in Salesforce Building Custom Mappings in GetFeedback Mapping Custom Values to Salesforce Custom Mapping Types Essentials feature : Available on Essentials, Pro, and Ultimate plans. Use custom mappings to send data to standard or custom objects, create or update records, or create activity records in Salesforce. Custom mappings make it easy to pass survey response data to Salesforce in the way that makes sense for your team and use case. If you only want to map survey titles, questions, and responses to Salesforce to use in reports, you can use our Managed Mapping package instead. The Managed Mapping package automatically creates objects and mappings for you. Video Before You Start Make sure to add your Salesforce connection to GetFeedback . Your GetFeedback administrator may need to give you permission to add connections. Then, connect your survey to Salesforce . (optional) Setting Up Custom Objects in Salesforce Create the custom objects you want to map to in Salesforce. Make sure the object label and name are related to the survey you’re mapping to (example: NPS Survey). If you’re passing responses to a common object already in Salesforce, skip to Creating Custom Mappings in GetFeedback. Make sure to enable permissions to read and write to this object. Custom Fields Once you save your Custom Object, define custom fields on the object. The custom fields on your object will hold survey responses, merge fields, and any other survey information that you map to Salesforce, like completion date or response language. Make sure to do the following for your custom object: Add a custom field for each piece of information in your survey you want to store in this Custom Object. Example: If you have three questions in your survey, a 'First Name' merge field, and a 'Survey Completed Time' response attribute that you want to map to this custom object, you’ll create 5 custom fields. Create one for each question, one for the merge field, and one for the Survey Completed Time attribute. When you create a custom field, decide which type of data field you're mapping to. The field type you can use depends on which type of question or value you're mapping to this custom field. Make sure you can write to these fields. GetFeedback can’t push data to read-only fields. Lookup Relationships This is also where you can add Lookup Relationships . A lookup relationship allows survey responses that are mapped to this object to be associated with another object, such as the Contact object. This requires you to pull the associated ID (such as the Contact ID) into your survey responses, at the time you send out your survey. Once you create a lookup relationship with your custom object, we map any related IDs as a merge field for any lookup relationship. Now that your Salesforce is set up to receive GetFeedback survey response data, you can create your custom mappings in GetFeedback. Building Custom Mappings in GetFeedback Create your custom mappings to send data to Salesforce. Consider the following when creating your mappings: Decide where your data is going to live in Salesforce . This helps you decide which object you want to map survey responses to. Decide what you want to do with the data . You may want to create a new record or update an existing one. If you choose to update a record, you'll need to add a merge field that includes the ID for the record you're updating in your object. Otherwise, GetFeedback won't know which record to update, and the mapping could fail. To create custom mappings in GetFeedback: From the survey builder, select Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings . Choose a Salesforce connection if you haven’t already. Select Add Mapping . Select a Salesforce object to map responses to. Select an action to perform. You can Create a new record , Update fields on an existing object , Create or update an existing object , or Create an Activity on an existing object . Select a mapping condition. Every time : Map all survey responses to Salesforce. Only when : Only map responses that match certain conditions. If you choose this option, set up filters to determine which responses to map to Salesforce. Learn more Review your mapping, then select Continue . Select a mapping source to determine what data you’ll map to Salesforce. Choose from any of the following options: An answer A merge field If you map a merge field, you’ll need to submit a test response of your survey first. Learn more about mapping merge fields in Salesforce A response attribute Question text A fixed value A short answer's sentiment (using Text Analytics) Select the item you want to map to Salesforce, then choose if you want to map it every time or only when it meets certain conditions. Choose the Salesforce field to map this item to. Select Add . You can now create more mappings, if needed. When you’re ready, select Save to save your mappings. You can now view and edit your mappings from the Salesforce Custom Mappings page. Make sure to test your mappings and merge fields before sending out your first live survey. Each question in the associated NPS survey is mapped to a corresponding field within Salesforce, along with a First Name merge field and a Completion Time response attribute. The Survey Name is automatically mapped to Salesforce, along with any Contact ID included as a merge field. Mapping Custom Values to Salesforce You may want to map different values into Salesforce than the answer choice values shown in your survey. You can map a value that represents the respondent’s answer choice (such as an acronym, ID number, or numerical value) instead of the answer. Custom value mapping can only be used with Multiple Choice questions. To map custom values to Salesforce: From the survey builder, select Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings . Choose the settings for your mappings, then select Continue . In the Add a Mapping for Answer section, select Map an answer . Choose your multiple choice question. Under Salesforce Field , select Customize mapped values . Enter the custom values to map into Salesforce for each question. Select Done . Continue building your mappings, then save them when you’re done. Custom Mapping Types You can use custom mappings to Create a new record , Update fields on an existing object , Create or update an existing object , or Create an Activity on an existing object . Creating a New Record Create a record of any type. Creating a new record works best when you map responses to a dedicated custom object, but you can also create a new contact or opportunity from survey responses. Once you’ve set up your custom object in Salesforce, you’ll be ready to build your custom mappings. Updating an Existing Record Update existing records of a certain type, such as a Case or Account. When you want to update an existing record: Build the fields you want to update before creating your mappings. Include the Record ID of the record you want to update as a merge field on your survey. We update this record with response data when someone completes your survey. Creating an Activity Record You can’t easily run reports or build dashboards with plain text in an activity record. It’s best to map your GetFeedback survey response data by creating a new custom object record or updating an existing record, in addition to setting up an Activity on a standard object. You can create Activity records associated with any of the Salesforce record IDs you added. For example, if you add Case ID and Owner to the survey as merge fields, the custom mapping creates a new activity on those records. Select the Activity record to see the mapping details. Each Activity record should include a link to the response, the survey summary, and the plain text version of the survey response. The Activity record serves as a complete record of all interactions with this customer.

How to use In-Form Piping,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/in-form-piping/,"How to use In-Form Piping | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Why is In-Form Piping Useful? How to Set Up In-Form Piping ame Page vs. Next Page Piping Same Page Calculation for Total Income Next Page Calculation for Total Income Basic Piping Variables Piping from Different Question Types Help Advanced Features How to use In-Form Piping Apply How to use In-Form Piping Why is In-Form Piping Useful? How to Set Up In-Form Piping ame Page vs. Next Page Piping Same Page Calculation for Total Income Next Page Calculation for Total Income Basic Piping Variables Piping from Different Question Types Piping Variables are helpful for passing information from one field to another. Piping Not only can you pipe information between forms, but you can also pipe information internally within a form. This article introduces in form piping and will cover how to use this piping with the various form question types in order to pass data and perform AEP calculations. Why is In-Form Piping Useful? In form piping allows you to pass information from one field to another within in the same form. This is commonly used for Advanced Expression Piping (AEP) when it comes to passing values into formulas. It can also be used to pipe responses between pages. For example, if the applicant provides their project name at the beginning of the form and you want this to visually appear at the top of each page they access. You can take the responses to the questions on the first page and pipe them into Section Headings on each new page. Piping can also be done between different forms using generated piping variables. However, what it easier about In-Form piping is that you can simply use the Question Identifier to pass the information instead of a lengthy piping variable. How to Set Up In-Form Piping o set up piping within your form: Add an Identifier to the question you are piping from Create a question to pipe your response into Depending on the question type (see table below) enter your variable in the corresponding field Start your expression by adding 2 curly brackets {{ Add a space after the second bracket Enter the exact identifier you gave to the question you are piping from NOTE: Identifiers are case sensitive After your expression add a space. Close your rule with 2 closed curly brackets }} For example, if ""Organization Name"" is your original question and the identifier is ""org_name"" we would use {{ org_name }} as the In-Form Piping variable. Any reference to this field outside of the form must use the system generated piping variable. You can pipe response into the following question types: Question Type Field to Pipe into Section Heading Title or Description Text Response Initial Value field Hidden Value Hidden Value field Single Column - Text Response Initial Value field Multi-Column - Text Response Initial Value field Same Page vs. Next Page Piping When performing In-Form Piping, although it is possible to perform piping within the same page there is one major limitation: you are not able to pipe from a piped variable within the same page. The below section will outline the process for both Advanced Expression Piping and Basic Piping Variables . Advanced Expression Piping For example, within our form, we are trying to calculate revenue and expenses. Therefore with our budget we calculate the totals into two fields into a new field using an AEP Formula: Question Question Identifier Expression Total Expenses total_expenses {{ SUM(expenses[:0]) }} Total Revenue total_revenue {{ SUM(revenue[:0]) }} Now that we have the values for each of the totals we want to find the difference between them to find the total income. Same Page Calculation for Total Income If it’s required to have this calculation on a single page, use a combination of SUM expressions to calculate on the same page instead. This is shown in the table below: Incorrect Calculation Correct Calculation Total Income {{ total_revenue-total_expenses }} {{ SUM(revenue[:0])-SUM(expenses[:0]) }} The restriction implied is that we will not be able to use ""total_revenue"" and ""total_expenses"" within a new formula on the same page. Therefore {{ total_revenue-total_expenses }} will not work correctly if the formula exists on the same page as the Total Revenue and Total Expenses questions. TIP! Alternatively, as a workaround you can use the original sum calculations to get the same result. Next Page Calculation for Total Income In order for this formula to calculate ""total_revenue"" and ""total_expenses"" correctly, you will need to create a new page and place the Total Income formula on the new page. Basic Piping Variables The same logic stated above for Advanced Expression Piping, will also affect Basic Piping Variables within a form. As you will not be able to pipe into a question, and then use that piped variable to pipe into another question on the same page. For example, the following piping cannot be met if the last two questions exist on the same page. Question Identifier Piped Response Question 1 q1 Question 2 q2 {{ q1 }} Question 3 q3 {{ q2 }} <-- this value may error out due to question 2's response being a piped value. Piping from Different Question Types Provided below is a list of each question type available within the form and how they will appear once they are piped into another question. Some question types do not support piping. Question Type How it appears Section Heading You will not be able to pipe from this question type. However, you will be able to pipe into the Section Heading Title and Description from other question types. Text Response The exact value given to the Text Response will be piped into the new field. Multiple Choice The choice selected by the user will be piped into the new field. Dropdown The choice selected by the user will be piped into the new field. Checkbox All choices selected will be piped into the new field in a list, separated by commas (no spaces). Example: Choice 1,Choice 2,Choice 3. Single Column This will pipe in the responses given to each variable type. TIP! Use cell indexing , to pipe a specific response from the question. Multi-Column This will pipe in the responses given to each variable type. TIP! Use grid indexing , to pipe a specific response from the question. Hidden Field Pipes the value entered into the Hidden Field. NOTE: Hidden fields can only be viewed and edited by administrators. Date/Time You will not be able to pipe from this question type. Datasource Question You will not be able to pipe from this question type. Drill Down Will pipe the final choice selected into the new field. NOTE: This will not pipe in the initial category that is selected Ranking Question The order of your variables will be piped into a list. NOTE: Only the choices themselves will be piped, not the corresponding variables. JavaScript You will not be able to pipe from this question type. Signature You will not be able to pipe from this question type.

Log in Sign up free Custom Variables is a logic feature you can use with a Web Link collector to track data about people who take your survey. It passes data you put in your survey link into your survey results. Video Overview Setting Up Custom Variables Create custom variables when designing your survey, then add them to your Web Link collector before you send it out. Once you have responses, you can see your custom variables when you export. 1. Creating them in your survey design To add custom variables: Click the Design Survey tab. In the left sidebar, click the Logic icon. Click Custom Variables . Click + New custom variable . Set up the first variable: Variable Name (required) - This goes in the Web Link. Label (optional) - This shows in your survey results, to help you track what each variable is for. Click Save . 2. Adding them to your Web Link Now that you have custom variables in your survey, it’s time to create your survey link and add custom values to each variable. To create your Web Link and add values: Click the Collect Responses tab. Create a Web Link collector . Copy the survey link. The template for adding your custom values will already be added to the end of the link and will follow this format: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/your_survey?var1=[var1_value]&var2=[var2_value]&var3=[var3_value] Outside of SurveyMonkey (in Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, etc.), replace the bracketed values with the values you want to pass through the URL. Custom variables are case sensitive, so make sure they match what you entered in the Design Survey section. Send each link to the people you want to take the survey. TIP! If you set the Survey End Page to redirect respondents to the website of your choice, custom variables will also pass through to the redirect URL. 3. Viewing them in your results In the Analyze Results tab, you can filter by custom variables . You can see custom variables at the end of each row in All Responses Data XLS or SPSS export types . Example Let's say you want to send out a short employee survey to three members of your Research department. Instead of asking each respondent to fill out their name, department, and title in the survey itself, you want to track this information about them through the survey link using Custom Variables. Here's how you would do this, from beginning to end: Design Survey Create 3 variables based on the respondent information you want to pass through the survey link. Variable Name: n Label: Name Variable Name: dept Label: Department Variable Name: t Label: Title Collect Responses Create a Web Link Collector. When you view the link, the template for adding your custom values will already be appended to the end of it: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/your_survey? n = [n_value] & dept = [dept_value] & t = [t_value] Outside of SurveyMonkey, create a unique link for each respondent by replacing the bracketed values with each person's Name, Department, and Title. Send each unique link to each respective respondent. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/your_survey? n = Lizzie & dept = Research & t = Intern https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/your_survey? n = Jenna & dept = Research & t = Analyst https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/your_survey? n = Hailee & dept = Research & t = SurveyDesigner Analyze Results Download an All Responses Data XLS, or SPSS export to see the custom variables paired with each response. In the spreadsheet, the results for this one-question survey will look like this: Which do you like best? Name Department Title Option Banana Lizzie Research Intern Option Banana Jenna Research Analyst Option Apple Hailee Research SurveyDesigner Limitations Expand | Collapse URL Length Web Link collectors can attach up to 100 custom variables to the URL. So you don't exceed universal URL length limitations, we suggest URLs remain under 2,000 characters to maintain functionality with popular web browsers. Forbidden Characters and Variable Names You can't use the following in Variable Names, Variable Labels, or as values inserted into the survey link template: Letters with accents (for example, À, É, ï, ó, Û, ñ, or ÿ) Special characters like: - – — # ? & ; You can't use the following in Variable Names: sm mode c cid rid r s sv pID s_mod PREVIEW_MODE Fmt prizeshown Token Disqualify overquota lang javascript No Way to Automatically Insert Values There is no way to automatically insert values into the survey link template within SurveyMonkey. You will need to do this manually, or run your own script to insert the values into the survey link template, outside of SurveyMonkey. If you are uncomfortable with this approach, consider using the Email Invitation Collector to track custom data about respondents. Collector Options Custom variables don't work with Recurrences . Turn off the Recurrence collector option to make sure your custom variables work properly. Deletion Custom variables cannot be deleted once responses have been collected.

Zendesk Automation and our Quick Launch setups in GetFeedback Direct let you add custom mappings to your survey to sync results back to Zendesk tickets. Before You Start Make sure to add a Zendesk connection and set up automated emails for the survey. If you use a Quick Launch setup , we create your connection and automation for you. Custom mappings default to your survey’s live Zendesk connection. To change the connection, go to your survey and select Settings. Setting up Zendesk Custom Mappings If a Zendesk ticket is Closed, we can’t map survey responses back to it. When setting up Zendesk Automation , we recommend that you set survey access to end before the ticket closes. To set up custom mappings for a survey: Create or open the survey you have connected to Zendesk. If you want to map an existing survey to Zendesk, your survey needs to have at least 2 test responses submitted. If you create a new survey, you don’t need to have any responses yet. In the left sidebar, select Mappings > Zendesk Custom Mappings . Select New Mapping . Select your mapping type: either Add survey response as internal note or Update custom field on ticket . Syncing Data When Conditions Match Add conditions to only map responses when an answer or custom variable matches a condition. For example, choose to only map responses when someone selects Very Unsatisfied for a CSAT question. To map all responses to Zendesk, select every time a response is received . To choose when to map responses: To only map responses that meet conditions, select only when conditions are met . Select the survey data to base your condition on: an answer or a custom variable . Set up your condition. Once you create your condition, you can start creating your mapping. Creating a Mapping You can create two types of mappings: an internal note mapping and a custom field mapping . Internal Note Mapping Post a summary of the survey response to the ticket as an internal note in the comments thread. Internal note mapping can help you quickly view customer responses and is helpful even if you use custom mappings. To map survey responses to Zendesk as an internal note, select Add survey response as internal note . Then, select Save Mapping . Custom Field Mapping Map survey responses to custom ticket fields on the Zendesk ticket. You can map answers to a question or custom data to custom ticket fields. Custom data is extra information that you can add to your tickets, such as the survey language or the region you sent it to. If you use Zendesk Explore, use custom field mapping so you can analyze data and share reports in Zendesk. To map answers to custom fields: For Mapping type , select Update ticket fields . (Optional) Add any conditions for your mapping. In the table, select Add data and field . For Survey data , select Answer to question or Custom data . Enter your custom data, or select the question to map responses from. For Custom field , select the field you want to map answers to. We show compatible fields at the top of the list. Learn more about compatible Zendesk fields If you map to a multi-select or dropdown field in Zendesk, match the answer choices to the corresponding Zendesk field values. Select Done . When you’re done creating mappings, select Save in the top right corner. Editing Mappings To edit a mapping: From your survey, select Mappings > Zendesk Custom Mappings . Find your mapping in the table, then select the three dots . Select Edit . Update your mapping, then select Done . Deleting Mappings To delete a mapping: From your survey, select Mappings > Zendesk Custom Mappings . Find your mapping in the table, then select the three dots . Select Delete .

Log in Sign up free A word cloud is a visual representation of the most common words and phrases from your open-ended responses. If you have data stored in our Canadian Data Center , this feature isn't available. You can see if this applies to you by checking your Account Details . How It Works A word cloud shows common important words and phrases survey-takers write in open-ended responses. Each phrase in a word cloud can be between 1-5 words. The word cloud can identify singular and plural words, tense variation, and other similar words and phrases, then groups them together to display as a single word.

Trap Questions,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/trap-questions/,"Trap Questions | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Examples Do I need to add trap questions to my survey? Help Creating Surveys Trap Questions SurveyMonkey Trap Questions Examples Do I need to add trap questions to my survey? Survey creators sometimes add trap questions (or red herring questions) to their surveys to ensure respondents are thoroughly reading the survey questions and not rushing through the survey or satisficing. Adding one or two trap questions allows you to filter out respondents who don't correctly answer the trap question. To do this, filter your survey results by question and answer and only show responses from respondents who chose the correct answer choice. Examples A common trap question is a Multiple Choice question where you ask respondents to select a particular answer choice. Please select B as your answer choice. A B C D E You could also choose to add an incorrect answer choice and filter out respondents who select it. What is your favorite flavor of ice cream? Vanilla Chocolate Strawberry Soccer Mint Chocolate Chip To make your trap question even more difficult to spot, you can add it as a row in a Matrix question. Do I need to add trap questions to my survey? Trap questions are also a common way to identify and control error when purchasing online panels. However, if you're purchasing responses via SurveyMonkey Audience , we feel there is little need for trap questions. We've tested the quality of SurveyMonkey Audience responses by sending the same survey through SurveyMonkey Audience and several other online panel providers. The validity rate for SurveyMonkey Audience was higher in comparison to other panel providers.

Video Before You Start Before automating emails, connect your survey to Salesforce. From the survey builder, go to Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings to connect the survey to your integrated Salesforce environment. If you use a survey question as your email call to action, remove the title page of the survey. In the survey builder, hover over the title page and select X to remove the page. Then, publish your survey again. Creating Your Email Template Build your automation in the Live version of your survey. When you publish your survey, any Draft settings will be erased and can’t be recovered. Your Draft settings won't be published to the Live email. To create your Visualforce template: From your survey, select Distribute > Email > Visualforce to start creating your template. Choose your Email call to action . Embed a button or survey question directly in your email. If you choose a survey question, use the first question. If you use a later question, the survey still opens in the browser on the first question. Enter an Email subject . Adding Merge Fields Add the merge fields in your survey. Use any fields that you’re mapping data to so the survey responses map back to Salesforce correctly. You can also add other fields that you want to track. For example, if you’re sending surveys after closing a case, you can add the Case Owner field to track the agent who handled the case. If you're mapping your survey to a custom object, make sure to include any lookup relationship information. For example, if you have a lookup relationship between Case and Account, include the accountid merge field here. Select the Salesforce object that will trigger your email. The object you choose determines which fields you can use in your survey. For example, select Case as your object if you want to send surveys after closing a case. Then, you can add fields from the Case object, such as Contact Name or Case Owner. (optional) Add merge fields from your object: Select +Salesforce field . Select the field to add. Select Add . (optional) Add other merge fields to track additional data: Select +Merge field . For Merge field name , enter the name to use for the merge field in GetFeedback. For Merge field value , enter the merge field to pull data from Salesforce. Select Add . Designing Your Email We apply the colors and background from your survey theme to your email template. You can optionally add your logo and customize your email message. To add your logo, select Add a logo in the template preview. Then, upload your image. To add a greeting, select Add an optional greeting in the template preview, then enter your text. To add body text, select Add an optional message in the template preview, then enter your text. Personalizing Your Email You can use any merge fields you added to personalize your email subject, greeting, and message. For example, you can use the Name field to add your respondent’s name to the email subject. Salesforce automatically fills in this information for each email recipient when sending the email. To personalize your email with merge fields: Place your cursor where you want to add a merge field in the subject, greeting, or message field. Select Personalize . Select the merge field to add. Enter a fallback term to use when the merge field is empty. For example, use “valued customer” as a fallback term when the contact’s name isn’t available. Select Insert . The merge field will display in your email template. Exporting Your Template To export your template, scroll to the bottom of the left panel and select Export . To copy the template code, select Copy & Close . To send the code to someone else, such as your Salesforce administrator, enter an email address and select Send . We’ll send the template code to that email address. You can now upload the template to Salesforce to use for your emails.

A survey response is one survey taker's submission of a survey, whether they completed the survey or only partially completed it. Responses are recorded in the Analyze Results section of your survey when survey takers click the navigation buttons in the survey. Responses are recorded when a survey taker completes a page of the survey and clicks the Next button to continue to the next page. Responses are recorded when a survey taker finishes the survey and clicks the Done button. If a respondent clicks Next or Done and they haven't answered a required question or they haven't properly answered a question with validation , they will see an error message. Their responses won't be recorded until they answer the question and click Next or Done again.

Sending texts via SurveyMonkey helps you reach a large audience quickly, avoid spam filters, and make your survey more accessible to people on mobile devices. Anytime texts are sent, credits are deducted from your team's text balance . The Primary Admin controls which members of the team can use the Text Message collector.

If you already have a collector for your survey, select Text Message . Add recipients . Click Edit to identify your company name in the Message . Edit the collector Options . Optional: Click Test to send a test text . Click Send . Check the box to confirm that all SMS recipients have consented to receiving these text messages from me in accordance with applicable law, and I have identified my company in my message . Click Send Text . You can't customize the number the text is sent from. Message Your message needs to include your company name but can't contain links. You can add special characters, code, or emojis, but they may take up additional character space and count towards your character limit. Texts sent per recipient lets you know if 1 or 2 texts will be sent to each recipient. If you can’t Save your message, shorten your message until you can. Recipients will receive your custom message, the survey link, and the following opt out text, which isn’t editable: Reply HELP for info. STOP to opt out. Msg&DataRatesMayApply Expand | Collapse Text Message Language In the Design Survey section, you can change your survey language . The opt out text is automatically translated to this language, but you need to provide your own translations for your survey title, questions, and answers. Don't share personal information other than your company name Don’t include any personal information, for example people’s names or other information that identifies a person or business, other than your company name. If you include personal information in the text message and receive a Right to be Forgotten request , you may have to delete the entire collector and all responses it collected in order to fulfill the request. Options Update the collector options to control the survey taking experience or add restrictions to the survey. To add your team's custom domain , click on Custom URL under Options and select On, show a custom URL for survey . Add Contacts Contacts need to have a US, CA, UK, or AU phone number. AU customers are only able to text AU numbers. There are a couple ways to add recipients to your text message: Type or paste phone numbers into the Send To field and hit enter. You can also add contact groups . Click Add Contacts to import new contacts, upload a CSV spreadsheet, import from another site, or copy and paste a list of phone numbers. Any new phone numbers you enter or import are saved in Contacts . You can add up to 5,000 contacts per text message. After you send your text message , you won't be able to send more texts with the same collector. But you can create a new collector for the same survey to send more texts. TIP! Use custom data to include info you know about your survey takers in the survey results. Import Formatting SurveyMonkey automatically updates the format of your contacts’ information to E.164 format to help you avoid import errors. Your recipient phone numbers are updated in the Send To field to include the country code and your contacts’ phone numbers are updated in the Send To field to include the country code and contact name if custom data is saved in your account. All non-numeric characters are removed. You can manually enter or import a CSV file with phone numbers in these formats: US and CA UK AU +1xxxxxxxxxx +44xxxxxxxxxx (E.164 format) +61xxxxxxxxx (xxx) xxx-xxxx 0xxxx xxxxxx (Local format) 0xxx xxx xxx xxxxxxxxxx 011 44 xxxx xxxxxx (International US outbound format) 011 61 xxx xxx xxx xxx-xxx-xxxx Import options and troubleshooting errors Manual and CSV Import If you’re pasting information using the manual import option or importing a CSV file, list the data in this order: Email address, Phone number, First name, Last name, Custom 1, Custom 2, etc. You can leave a blank space between commas or in a column cell if you don’t have information for a contact. If you see an error about invalid contacts or that “something went wrong” when you add recipients or try to send a text message, it means your list wasn't formatted correctly or you added duplicate, opted out, or bounced phone numbers. TIP! View an image of an example CSV to see correct formatting. Email Import You can use Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, LinkedIn, Office 365, or Outlook.com to import all your contacts. If you make changes to contacts in your email account, they're not reflected in SurveyMonkey. Your SurveyMonkey account is not synced to those applications. To add only some contacts or to import contacts from another email provider or site, go to your email account and export the contacts you want as a CSV file, then import the file to SurveyMonkey. Outlook.com, the free web-based email service formerly known as Hotmail.com, differs from the Microsoft Office Outlook mail application. To import contacts from Microsoft Office Outlook, first export your contacts into a CSV file, and then import the file. Or ask your IT department if your Outlook application is powered by Office 365. Troubleshoot Import Errors If you see an error about invalid contacts or that “something went wrong” when you add contacts or try to send a text message, it means: Your list wasn't formatted correctly, or You added a duplicate, opted out, or bounced phone number. Tidy up your manual list or spreadsheet, then try to import again. Here are some tips: Don't import a spreadsheet with more than 1,000 phone numbers. Break your text message contacts into multiple CSV files with less than 1,000 rows each and import them to multiple collectors. Or copy and paste the rows of the spreadsheet using the manual import option. Delete the header row from your spreadsheet. Make sure you're using an accepted delimiter for the spreadsheet (colon, semicolon, pipe, comma, or tab), and that your character encoding is in Unicode ( UTF-8 or UTF-16). If you're using a Mac, try saving your file as MS-DOS Comma Separated (.csv). Go to File > Save As > Format. Preview and Send Your Text Message As you update your message and options, the mobile preview on the right shows a preview of your text. Test Your Text Message You can send a test text to any US, CA, UK, or AU phone number. The survey link in the test lets you preview the survey without recording any responses. Sending test messages may use up to 2 texts from your text balance . Send Your Text Message When you're ready, click Send . Make sure you're following our Acceptable Uses Policy and check the box to confirm that all SMS recipients have consented to receiving these text messages from me in accordance with applicable law, and I have identified my company in my message . It's your responsibility to only send surveys to people who have agreed to receive texts from you. Then you can click Send Text . It isn't possible to schedule a text message to send later, send reminder or thank you texts, or invite more recipients on the same collector. But you can create a new Text Message collector to send more texts. Track Contacts and Analyze Your Results Track Responses and Recipients See the number of texts you sent, whether any phone numbers bounced, and the number of responses you received in the Overview tab. You can see a list of recipients added to the collector and their individual response status from the Recipients tab. Click All recipients to filter recipients. If you want to edit recipient details, you can make edits in Contacts . Expand | Collapse Opted out or bounced phone numbers You can’t send messages to people who have opted out or bounced . You can check for opted out or bounced phone numbers in the Recipients tab. People who’ve opted out or bounced at some point in the past can opt back in if they want to take your survey. After they opt back in, you need to create a new Text Message collector to send them the survey (the old collector will continue to list them as opted out or bounced). Delete recipients If a recipient requests their Right to Erasure , the account holder needs to delete all the recipient's personal and response data. To delete a recipient from the collector: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Open the Text Message collector used to send your survey. Click on the Recipients tab. Click on the recipient's row. Click on Remove recipient record . This removes the recipient from the Text Message collector. When you receive a Right to Erasure request, we also recommend that you: Delete the individual's response Delete the recipient's contact Analyze Results From the Analyze Results section of your survey, you can browse, filter, and compare responses. You can filter by collector or custom data to narrow down responses. If your contacts include custom data, you can see it in individual responses or in responses data exports , unless anonymous responses was turned on. TIP! Recipient phone numbers aren't included in Analyze Results, so we recommend using custom data to see identifiable info like first name, last name, or other useful data. Team Settings Allow People to Send Surveys by Text Message By default, no one on the team has access to send surveys by text message. The Primary Admin controls whether people on your team can send surveys by text message . They also choose who can send surveys by text message—their entire team or only specific people .

Using Templating to Customize Notifications & Confirmation Emails,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/build/custom-templates/,"Using Templating to Customize Notifications & Confirmation Emails | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo In this article How it Works Null or Blank Values Where You Can Use Templates Reformatting Dates & Times Help Build a Form Form Settings, Rules & Logic Using Templating to Customize Notifications & Confirmation Emails Wufoo Using Templating to Customize Notifications & Confirmation Emails How it Works Null or Blank Values Where You Can Use Templates Reformatting Dates & Times Templating lets you personalize notification and confirmation messages by adding bracketed templates that are dynamically replaced with data and metadata specific to that entry. You could also think of templating as merge tags. How it Works Templates consist of two parts: the template and the parameter . In the example below, {entry:} is the template, which tells Wufoo to pull info from entry data, and Field5 is the parameter, which tells Wufoo what exactly to pull from the entry. Here's a template you might add to your confirmation message: Thanks for filling out my form, {entry:Field5}! When someone completes your form, the bracketed template in the confirmation message is replaced with their entry to Field 5—in this case, the field where they entered their first name: Thanks for filling out my form, Beyoncé! Null or Blank Values If there's no data to replace a template with—for example, if someone leaves a field blank—we'll just replace the bracketed template with a blank space. Where You Can Use Templates Templating requires an entry to be created before you can pull data about that entry into other areas. So you can't use templating within the form itself, but instead you can use templating in several places that you or respondents see after submitting an entry to your form. The following areas support templating: Confirmation Emails (Subject & Message Fields) Notification Emails (Subject Field) Integrations (Notes Field) ""Show Text"" Confirmation Option ""Redirect to Website"" Confirmation Option * * We suggest only using the {entry:EntryId} template in redirect URLs. You may also use any of the other templates listed below, but we advise against it since we don’t provide a way to URL encode the URL. This means if you have an unacceptable character (non-ascii or control character like a slash) in your template output, the URL will break. In other words, depending on what characters the person filling out your form enters into their response, there's a chance that it might break the redirect URL. Data Sources & Formatting Guide You can pull information into templates from lots of different data sources—answers to fields in your form, entry metadata (information about the person's entry), form metadata (information about your form), or details about someone's payment. Data Source Template Description Field Data {entry:Field # } Inserts the respondent's answer to this field. Replace # with the API ID of the field. How to find the API ID for a field » Entry Metadat a {entry:EntryId} Inserts the entry number . {entry:DateCreated} Inserts the date and time the entry was created. {entry:IP} Inserts the IP address of the computer that submitted the entry. Payment Info {entry:TransactionId} Inserts the unique ID of the payment transaction. This can only be used on payment forms using the Authorize.net or PayPal Payflow Pro merchants. {entry:PurchaseTotal} Inserts the total amount paid (numerical value). Payment forms only. Form Metadata {form:FormId} Inserts the unique ID of the form. {form:Name} Inserts the Form Name . {form:Description} Inserts the Form Description . Reformatting Dates & Times You can add an extra piece to your template to reformat dates and times to be clearer and more pleasant to look at. For example, instead of displaying the answer to a Time field as 20:00:00 (the default format), you can display the time as 8:00 PM instead. You can control the format of the date and time outputs from the following data sources: Time Field Date Field Date & Time Created Default Outputs If you don't add any special formatting, this is how date & time outputs will look. Syntax for Reformatting Dates & Times To change the format of a date or time output, you can use the following syntax: {entry: parameter |date_format:"" format string ""} Replace parameter with either the Field# that corresponds with a Date or Time question on your form, or DateCreated , which would reference the date & time the entry was created. Replace format string with your preferred Date/Time Formatting Characters » , which are characters you can mix and match to display your date and time data in exactly the way you want. Any characters that you include in the format string that aren't included in the list linked above will appear as-is. For example, you can add colons (:) and slashes (/) inside the quotes so they'll appear between the pieces of data. Example Date & Time Templates Here are some popular examples of date and time templates you can use: Data Source Example Template Example Output Description Time Field {entry:Field # |date_format:""H:i""} 20:00 24-hour clock, without seconds {entry:Field # |date_format:""g:i A""} 8:00 PM 12-hour clock, including AM or PM Date Field {entry:Field # |date_format:""m/d/Y""} 07/16/1969 MM/DD/YYYY format {entry:Field # |date_format:""d/m/Y""} 16/07/1969 DD/MM/YYYY format {entry:Field # |date_format:""D M d Y""} Wed Jul 16 1969 The three-letter abbreviation of the day and month, followed by the numerical day and year. Date & Time Created {entry:DateCreated|date_format:""M d Y g:iA""} Jun 16 2016 8:00 PM The date and time the entry was created, in a friendlier format. {entry:DateCreated|date_format:""M d Y""} Jun 16 2016 If you only want to include the date—not the time—you can enter a format string that accounts for the formatting of the date only. We'll exclude the time info.

Analyze Multiple Surveys Together,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/multi-survey-analysis/,"Analyze Multiple Surveys Together | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Before You Start How to Build Surveys for Dashboards Create a Multi-Survey Analysis Dashboard Add Surveys to a Multi-Survey Dashboard Manage Your Dashboard View Individual Responses Use Tiles to Analyze Data Add a Tile Manage Tiles Rearrange Tiles Filter and Break Down Dashboard Data Share Charts with Others Export Data Help Analyzing Results Understanding Your Results Analyze Multiple Surveys Together SurveyMonkey Analyze Multiple Surveys Together Before You Start How to Build Surveys for Dashboards Create a Multi-Survey Analysis Dashboard Add Surveys to a Multi-Survey Dashboard Manage Your Dashboard View Individual Responses Use Tiles to Analyze Data Add a Tile Manage Tiles Rearrange Tiles Filter and Break Down Dashboard Data Share Charts with Others Export Data Multi-survey analysis is available on Advantage Annual plans and higher in the US and EU Data Centers . Analyze multiple surveys in one place and track results from one or more surveys over time. You can: Analyze results from one or many surveys Track key metrics over time (longitudinal analysis) Add multiple visualizations for the same question Before You Start To analyze a survey in a dashboard, you need full access to the survey. Limitations Unsupported Question Types The following question types aren’t currently supported in multi-survey analysis: File Upload Click Map Payments Unsupported Data Types The following data types aren’t currently supported in multi-survey analysis: Benchmarks Respondent Metadata Custom Data (Contacts) Audience Metadata Tags Response Quality How to Build Surveys for Dashboards Here are some tips to help you build surveys for your dashboard. Consider what insights you want to get before building your surveys. Make sure to include question types that will help you get the information you need. Use the same or similar questions across surveys you want to compare. You can get the best insights from surveys that collect the same data points from different audiences. Consider using benchmarkable questions or questions from the Question Bank. These questions follow a standard format and that makes it easy to compare results in the same chart. Create a Multi-Survey Analysis Dashboard To create a multi-survey dashboard: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Multi-survey analysis (Beta) . If you have a dashboard for this survey, you'll see a list of dashboards that include the survey. If you haven't created a dashboard with this survey yet, you'll find a new dashboard for your survey. Review the charts for your survey. To add more surveys to your dashboard, select Add surveys . Add Surveys to a Multi-Survey Dashboard You can add surveys to your multi-survey analysis dashboard at any time. To add surveys: Open your dashboard. Select Add surveys , then choose the surveys to include in your dashboard. Select Save And Close . How to Choose Surveys for a Multi-Survey Dashboard Here are some tips to help you build a useful multi-survey analysis dashboard. Compare rating questions that use similar value ranges. If the ranges are too different, the results may be hard to visualize in a chart. For example, a rating question on a scale from 0-100 may not fit well in a chart with a question on a scale from 1-5. It’s easier to compare results from surveys that use questions from the Question Bank. These questions follow a standard format and that makes it easy to compare results in the same chart. You can compare large surveys that show the same questions to different people based on logic. For example, say you have an employee feedback survey that segments respondents by department using logic. You can compare the results from those questions in the same dashboard and tiles. Manage Your Dashboard Once you create your dashboard, you can make a few changes. You can: Edit the title or description Change the survey selection Duplicate the dashboard Delete the dashboard Edit dashboard title or description To edit the dashboard title , click the title, then enter new text. Press Enter to save your title. To edit the description: Select the three dots menu next to the Add New Tile button. Select Edit title and description .

Select Delete dashboard . View Individual Responses in the Response Explorer You can review the responses for all questions included in your dashboard. To review responses, expand the tray on the right side of your dashboard. Select a response to view all of the answers the respondent left on your survey. Use Tiles to Analyze Data Tiles are the building blocks of your dashboard. You can create and customize charts using tiles, and rearrange them to compare, contrast, and combine your data. There are several tile types you can use: Tile type Description Supported question types Available chart types NPS Visualize Net Promoter® Score (NPS) over time. View the score distribution between Detractors, Passives, and Promoters, or show the single score on your dashboard. Net Promoter Score (NPS) Line chart Vertical bar chart Pie chart Single score Average score CSAT % Track the average score across rating and matrix questions. View how the score has changed over time, or view how many people chose each option. This tile works great for Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) style questions. Rating Line chart Vertical bar chart Pie chart Single score Choice Review responses from questions where survey takers had to choose a single or multiple options. View the distribution of answers to see how many people chose each option. You can merge answers in the chart if they use the same question text, or you can show each answer option separately.

Your visualization options will change depending on the question types you include. Any question type supported in multi-survey analysis Line chart Vertical bar chart Pie chart Horizontal bar chart Tips for Using the Any Tile Here are some tips to get great visualizations using the Any tile. Include questions with similar value scales . For example, don’t compare a slider question on a scale from 1-100 with a slider question on a scale from 1-5. Include questions that collect the same types of data . For example, Matrix and Multiple Choice questions can work together well, but Ranking and Multiple Choice might not. Add a Tile The visualization options for each chart depend on the chart you choose and the data in your responses. You may not be able to select all visualization options for each tile. To add a tile to your dashboard: From your dashboard, select Add New Tile . (optional) Enter a title and description for your tile at the top of the page. Choose the tile type you want to add. TIP! If you can’t remember the question type you wanted, or you want to choose from all of your survey's questions, choose the Any tile. Select Continue To Data . Choose which questions to include in the tile. The table shows all questions that can be included in the tile. You can also search for a specific survey name or question. After choosing the questions to include, select Continue To Visualization . Choose the visualization you want to use. Then, set the Display options for the visualization you chose. The available display options may change for each tile type and visualization. Select Create Tile to add it to your dashboard. Repeat these steps to add more tiles to your dashboard.

You can’t change a tile’s type after adding it to your dashboard. To change the tile type, delete the tile and create a new one. Rearrange Tiles Rearrange your tiles to compare, contrast, and combine your data. You can put the most important visualizations at the top of your dashboard, or even put related tiles next to each other. To rearrange tiles , drag a tile to a new spot on your dashboard. You can place tiles above, below, or next to other tiles. You can place up to 2 tiles next to each other. TIP! Place 2 tiles that visualize the same data point next to each other. This makes it easy to compare results at a glance. Filter and Break Down Dashboard Data Filters apply to all tiles on your dashboard. To add a filter: Next to the date range at the top of the page, select Add Filter . Choose what data type you want to filter by, such as NPS or Multi-Choice. The number next to the data type shows how many questions include that type of data. Choose the question to filter by. Set a rule for your filter. For example, for a Rating filter, you can choose Is any of to include certain scores in your filter, or choose Is not to exclude certain scores. Select Apply to filter your data. TIP!

To view a different date range, select Date Range , then select a date range for your dashboard. Or, use the date fields to select a custom date range. Break Down Charts by Other Questions Some tiles will have a Breakdown By option. Use this option to break down the chart by other questions. This helps you understand how the chart data correlates to responses from other survey questions. Share Charts with Others Pin charts to a Results dashboard to share it with others. Any filters on your multi-survey analysis dashboard, including the date range, are applied to the pinned chart. You can only pin charts with data from a single survey. If a chart shows data from multiple surveys, the pin icon won't be available. To pin a chart to a Results dashboard: Find the chart you want to pin. Select the pin icon in the top right corner. Select the dashboard to pin the chart to. Your chart is pinned to the Results dashboard you chose. Updating Chart Filters The filters on the pinned chart can’t be changed in Dashboards and Crosstabs.

If you change the filters in Multi-survey Analysis, your charts in your Results Dashboard aren't automatically updated. Delete the chart from Present Results and pin it again to include any new filters. Export Data You can two export types: A spreadsheet of all survey data A single chart as a PNG If you’ve applied filters to your dashboard, your export will show the filtered data. Remove the filter to export the original data. Export All Surveys ENTERPRISE FEATURE : Full survey exports are available to users on Enterprise plans at this time.

Salesforce Case Closed Survey Workflows,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-case-closed/,"Salesforce Case Closed Survey Workflows | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Before You Start Create Custom Objects and Fields in Salesforce Setting Up Salesforce Survey Mappings Adding Merge Fields to Your Survey Link Designing an Email Template in Salesforce Creating a Case Closed Workflow in Salesforce Setting Conditions for your Case Closed Survey Help Salesforce Salesforce Automation Salesforce Case Closed Survey Workflows GetFeedback Salesforce Case Closed Survey Workflows Before You Start Create Custom Objects and Fields in Salesforce Setting Up Salesforce Survey Mappings Adding Merge Fields to Your Survey Link Designing an Email Template in Salesforce Creating a Case Closed Workflow in Salesforce Setting Conditions for your Case Closed Survey Essentials feature : Available on Essentials, Pro, and Ultimate plans. Automating your survey distribution lets you collect timely customer feedback and take action on it. You can use our Salesforce automation to send CSAT surveys after a customer interacts with your support team. We'll use a CSAT survey in this example but case closed workflows apply to other kinds of surveys like Customer Effort Score (CES) or Net Promoter Score (NPS). This article covers a manual process of automating case closed surveys. You can use our Quick Launch Setup in GetFeedback to automatically set up a case closed survey and workflow using our managed mappings package. If you need more customization, you can create automated emails using our Salesforce Automation . Before You Start Create the survey you want to send when someone closes a case. Keep the following in mind: Start with a rating question, such as a CSAT or NPS question. It's best to use 3-4 questions in your survey. Create Custom Objects and Fields in Salesforce Create a custom object in Salesforce to hold your survey responses. When creating your custom object: Custom objects typically have a lookup relationship with a standard object. Lookup relationships are like a parent/child relationship between your custom survey object and any other standard or custom object in Salesforce. For example, you can create a lookup relationship between the custom CSAT Survey object and the Contact object. Create a custom field for each survey answer you’ll map to the object. For example, create a number field to hold the CSAT score and a text field to hold an open-text answer. The image below shows an example of a custom CSAT Survey object: Setting Up Salesforce Survey Mappings In GetFeedback, create survey mappings to push responses to your custom Salesforce object. To set up mappings: From your survey in app.getfeedback.com, select Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings. Make sure to do this in draft mode. Connect your survey to your Salesforce environment if you haven't already. Select the custom Salesforce object you want to map responses to. For Action, select Create a new. Add any conditions, then select Continue. Finish creating your mapping. Learn more about creating custom mappings Once you save and publish your mappings, we push any new survey responses to the Salesforce object you chose. Adding Merge Fields to Your Survey Link Add the Case ID merge field to your survey link to associate responses with the case. You can also add merge fields for other data you want to track. From your survey, select Distribute > Survey link and copy your link. Then, add the Case ID merge field. Learn more about adding merge fields to survey links Designing an Email Template in Salesforce Your case closed survey email is the primary component of this workflow. When your support agent closes a case, the workflow sends the survey to the case contact. There are a few ways to send a survey over email: Include your survey link in the body of the Salesforce email. Embed the first question or a call to action into Visualforce template and send it from Salesforce. Creating a Case Closed Flow in Salesforce Salesforce will block the creation of workflow rules in Winter 2023. Learn more Once you create your email template in Salesforce, you can build the Salesforce flow. Learn more about creating flows in Salesforce Setting Conditions for your Case Closed Survey If you send surveys after each case closure in Salesforce, your customers may experience survey fatigue and stop responding to surveys. You can use certain workflow rules in Salesforce to limit how often you send surveys. For example, you can send the survey in the following conditions: Only for a certain number of cases (Ex.: every 6th case closed). Only after a period of time (Ex.: if the recipient hasn't submitted a survey in 7 days). Only for Certain Number of Case Closures You might want to trigger a survey for a certain number of cases only (Ex: every 4th case). To do this, you'll need to use formulas and workflow rules in Salesforce. Add an auto-number field to the Case object to assign each case a numeric value. This can easily be done by adding an auto-number field to the Case object that assigns each case number a numeric value of {0}.Adding an auto-number field assigns a whole number to each case. Use a Salesforce MOD formula to return the case number to 0 whenever it is divisible by 10. The end result will be a revolving set of numbers from 1-10 that resets to 0 whenever the case number hits 10. The screenshot below shows that formula set up for our environment. In it, the Survey_Send_Number__C field is the auto-number field we set up earlier. The 6 is the number to divide by. In this case, every 6th case will receive a survey. 2. Create a workflow rule that sends the survey when that MOD formula evaluates to zero (which will only happen every 6th case). This will be our workflow rule criteria. Only After Certain Time Periods You can limit how often surveys are sent to individual respondents to only send a survey after someone hasn’t completed a survey for a certain time period. To do this, use custom mappings to map the Completion Time attribute to Salesforce. The Completion Time attribute tells Salesforce when your recipient last completed a survey. Then, create a trigger in Salesforce to check the Completion Time before sending a survey. To only send surveys after a certain time period: In Salesforce, create a date field on the Contact object. In GetFeedback, create a custom mapping to map the response attribute Completion Time to the date field on the Contact object. 3. In Salesforce, create a trigger to distribute the survey based on these rules. The trigger needs to do 3 actions: Check the date on the contact for the case in question If the date is more than a certain time period (ex: 7 days) before the current date, send the survey. Otherwise, do nothing. If there is no date at all, send the survey.

Enable Multiline ii. Set the Row and Column width of the text field. This is the minimum default size of the question, users will still be able to expand the box if they require more space. Display Settings Setting Description Multiline Checking this option will make your text response box display more than one line. Rows will appear when this option has been checked. The greater the number of rows you enter, the longer your text response field will appear, up to a maximum of 25. Column This displays how wide the text response field is. By default, the field is 20 columns wide. You can make it wider for longer responses such as an Address or narrower for one-word responses. Display side-by-side Display this question side by side with another question. This will need to be enabled on the other question as well. Append to previous question This question type appends to the question before it to make it appear that they are connected within the form. NOTE: Any Branching Logic , such as to hide or show the previous question, will also apply to this question. However, the requirement settings won't be. If it is meant to be hidden it will need to be included in the branching logic as well. Width You can adjust the width based on a percentage of the size of the page. By default, the value is 100% to make it fit the size of the page. Options Settings Setting Description Optional Enabling this will make the question Optional. When a user enters the form, if the question is Optional they will be able to proceed and complete the form without providing a response to this question. The question will be required by default Hide Input The text entered will appear as dots instead of characters (great for sensitive information like SIN or Social Security numbers). The inputted data is still reportable and viewable as an administrator, however, it will be automatically hidden when the applicant inserts their response. It will also not be visible to reviewers or recommenders who are able to view the application. Restore Initial Value When a user comes back to this form page, this question will have its default value. TIP! Use this if you are using Piping Variables or Advanced Expression Piping within the question, it will ensure that the variable will look for the most up-to-date value. If this is not selected then as soon as the form is saved that response will remain. If the piping variable has been updated and you reenter the form the field will not update. Validation Add a restriction to what the user must enter into the field. For example, if you want to collect email addresses, then select email validation. Refer to How to Add Validation to a Text Response Question for more information. Initial Value Presents a default text response to the user. NOTE: If you are using Piping Variables or Advanced Expression Piping , you will input the variable into this field.

Types of Navigation Buttons Button Location Function Next End of each page (except last page) Saves the responses for that page in the Analyze Results section and proceeds to the next page in the survey. Previous End of each page (except first page) Allows the respondent to go back to the previous page to review or edit their response. Done End of the last page of the survey Submits the survey and saves the response as Complete in the Analyze Results section. Why are there two Done buttons? If you have a Custom Thank You turned on in the collector options, the page will have an additional Done button on it. There is no way to make these two buttons have different text. Customizing Buttons You can edit the button colors and text. It's not possible to change the button font. Button Text To edit the text on navigation buttons: Click the Design Survey tab. Click the navigation button you want to edit. Enter the preferred text. Click Save . Button Colors To edit the navigation button colors: Click the Design Survey tab.

To show the Previous button, turn on Response Editing—allow respondents to go back to previous pages in the survey and update existing responses. TIP! If you buy survey responses using SurveyMonkey Audience , we remove the Previous button from the survey, so it's not possible for respondents to go back to previous pages to edit their responses . Browser Navigation Buttons Respondents should not use browser navigation buttons to move through the survey. If a respondent clicks their web browser's Back button instead of the survey's Previous button, they can't change or save their responses on the previous page. Respondents may see a cached version of the previous page that won't accept new responses, or they may be prompted with a form resubmission error. Translations If you change the survey language , the default navigation button text will automatically change to match that language. Legacy Navigation Buttons The Exit link option is no longer available. This change shouldn’t impact your surveys, data, or the respondent’s experience when exiting a survey page. Respondents can exit surveys anytime by closing their browser tab or window. No matter how someone exits a survey page, the survey behavior is the same.

How to Convert a Value to a Single Floating Point (REAL),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/convert-to-real/,"How to Convert a Value to a Single Floating Point (REAL) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the REAL Function? Proper Formatting of REAL Expressions Help Advanced Features How to Convert a Value to a Single Floating Point (REAL) Apply How to Convert a Value to a Single Floating Point (REAL) What is the REAL Function? Proper Formatting of REAL Expressions Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. Using a REAL expression, results are displayed as a Single Floating Point (1.0, 2.5, 3.1, etc.) which can be ideal for reporting and display purposes. This article describes this expression further by providing use cases and rules for proper formatting. What is the REAL Function? The REAL function allows the expression to convert a set of values into an floating point or real value for either a single value or a list of values from a number of given fields. The difference between REAL and REALTWO is that REALTWO returns the value with two decimal places (1.00) whereas REAL converts the value to a single decimal place (1.0). Additionally, If you are looking to have more than two decimal places within your response, you will need to use PRECISION instead. Proper Formatting of REAL Expressions The setup and formatting of the REAL expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the REAL expression should be set up as follows: {{ REAL(variable1+variable2) }} Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of REAL and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive Always close the REAL operation with brackets ( ) What's different about REAL over some of the other functions is that REAL can be used in conjunction with other functions. For example, using the AVG Function, if we want to calculate the average of 3 values, should that value return a floating point, REAL can be used to ensure the value displays up to a single decimal point. REAL using addition {{ REAL(q1[0]+q1[1]) }} Ensures that the sum of q1[0] and q1[1] displays up to a single decimal place. REAL using subtraction {{ REAL(q2[1]-q1[0]) }} Ensures that the difference of q2[1] and q1[0] displays up to a single decimal place. REAL using multiplication {{ REAL(q1[1]*2) }} OR{{ REAL(q1[2]*q2[0]) }} Ensures the product of the multiplied values displays up to a single decimal place. REAL using division {{ REAL(q1[3]/4) }} OR{{ REAL(q2[0]/q1[1]) }} Ensures the quotient of the divided values displays up to a single decimal place. REAL with another function {{ REAL(SUM(q1[:0])) }} OR{{ REAL(AVG(q1[0],q1[2],[q1[3]) }} Ensure the result of the expression using another function displays up to a single decimal place. REAL will not round the value to the nearest number, it will simply remove any additional floating points to meet the Rule, therefore 1.69 will be 1.6 and not 1.7.

This guide describes the recommended permissions and when to enable them. You may also need to add certain IP addresses to your allow list (sometimes known as a whitelist). Recommended Salesforce Permissions Salesforce Permission Description Create, Read, Update, Delete for certain fields and objects Enable these permissions for any fields and objects you’re mapping responses to. API access Allow API access to connect GetFeedback to Salesforce and use our Salesforce Automation or Quick Launch . Modify Metadata through Metadata API Allow team members to modify metadata through API functions to use our Salesforce Automation or Quick Launch . Send Outbound Messages Enable this permission for any Salesforce user that will trigger outbound messages (ex: an agent who closes a case, if you’re using a Quick Launch Setup or a case closed flow ) Report access If you send surveys to a list using a Salesforce report , allow your team to access any reports they’ll use. Password never expires Enable this permission for the account you’re connecting to GetFeedback so the connection doesn’t break. View all users Enable this permission to send survey invitations using a trigger. Customize application Enable this permission to send survey invitations using a trigger. Required Permissions When Connecting via OAuth GetFeedback requests several permissions when you connect to Salesforce using OAuth. This is why we need these permissions: Permission Description Access your basic information Display ownership details of the credential used to connect Salesforce to GetFeedback in-app. This is helpful if your GetFeedback administrators allow team members to share credentials. Access and manage your data Allow GetFeedback to append survey response data to any specified records. Provide access to your data via the Web Allow GetFeedback to use the Salesforce API. Access and manage your Chatter data Allow a team member to create Chatter posts (""stories"") as part of mapping rules. Provide access to custom applications Allow GetFeedback to map data to custom objects. Allow access to your unique identifier Allow GetFeedback to access User IDs, which we need when we make a request to the Salesforce API. Access custom permissions GetFeedback inherits any permission sets or FLS applied to the user granting the OAuth connection. This means that if the user initiating the connection has reduced visibility into your object model, that reduced visibility will carry over into the list of objects and fields that can be displayed in GetFeedback. The Salesforce API respects your org's security rules, even when the GetFeedback app connects to it. Access and manage your Wave data Inherent with connected app access - this is displayed because Wave is installed. Access and manage your Eclair data Inherent with connected app access - this is displayed because Eclair is installed. Perform requests on your behalf at any time Keep the Salesforce API token, provided upon OAuth approval, valid until revoked. IP Addresses for Salesforce Connections If you're an admin in Salesforce but can't create connections in GetFeedback , you may need to add our IP addresses to your allow list (sometimes known as a whitelist).

Kiosk surveys work on tablets, mobile phones, and desktop computers. You can set your survey to restart after each response is submitted to reduce lag or set-up time between each survey session. Respondents will need to finish the survey in one session. Before You Start You’ll need a reliable internet connection to run your kiosk survey. GetFeedback doesn’t support offline surveys. Creating Your Survey Create the survey you want to use for your kiosk. By default, the survey will be anonymous, so consider adding a form question to capture information about who is taking your survey, such as name, phone number, email address, or physical address. Automatically Restarting Your Survey To automatically start the survey over after the last user submits their answers, set up a URL redirect at the end of the survey. A traditional URL redirect will take your users to an external website once their answers are submitted. In this case, you’ll use your own survey URL to reset the survey for the next respondent. To add a URL redirect to your survey: From your survey, select Distribute > Survey Link . In the Live Survey tab, copy the survey link. Go back to your survey. In the survey builder, select +Add an Exit Page, then choose URL Redirect. In the Redirect URL field on the right, paste your survey link. Publish your survey. When a respondent submits their responses, your survey will restart. Using Kiosk Mode It’s best to use a kiosk mode extension for your browser. Kiosk mode prevents your device from entering sleep mode and maximizes your browser so respondents can only see your survey. Refer to your browser or extension’s instructions to learn how to set up kiosk mode.

Customize your survey link’s domain, subdomain, and ending to make your link more relevant to your survey and respondents. Administrator users can enable this feature. Branding Your GetFeedback Subdomain Create a custom subdomain to include your branding in the survey link without removing the GetFeedback domain. The subdomain is the part before “getfeedback.com” in your survey link. The image below explains the structure of a link that uses a custom subdomain. If any of your live surveys use a custom link, avoid changing the domain or subdomain on the account. When a custom subdomain or domain is removed or changed , respondents won’t be able to access the survey with the previous domain or subdomain. To create your custom subdomain: From the GetFeedback homepage , select Settings > Custom URL > Edit . Enter your custom subdomain. This custom subdomain will be applied to all surveys you send. Select Save . If you share a live survey link before setting a custom domain or subdomain, that link will stay active even when a custom domain or subdomain is added. Customizing a Survey Link Ending Customize the survey link ending to make the link more relevant to your survey and respondents. The link ending, also known as the survey path, is the part after /r/ in your survey link. You’ll need to add a custom subdomain before changing the link ending. To customize the link ending: From your survey, select Distribute > Survey Link . Select the pencil button next to your link. Enter a custom link ending. Select Save . Removing GetFeedback From Survey Links You can use your own custom domain (example: www. mycompany .com) and remove GetFeedback from the survey link. Because GetFeedback doesn’t own your domain, we can’t automatically direct internet traffic from your domain without some additional configuration. However, you or your IT team can configure your domain's DNS settings so you can route traffic from your domain to your GetFeedback surveys. To set up a custom domain: Contact GetFeedback support at help@getfeedback.com to let them know what custom domain you’d like to set up. We’ll provide you with a CNAME target, which points to your desired custom domain to the DNS target (ex: feedback.surveys.com -> mxxxxn-cxxxxxn-5axxxxxxxx1.herokudns.com ) We’ll add the custom domain to your account and confirm the SSL for you. We'll let you know when the custom domain is live. Test your survey links to make sure they look good and render correctly.

Overview The automation log allows you to monitor and troubleshoot active automations within your site. Unlike the Email Logs, the Automation log is unique to and accessible from any program within a site.

The log will consist of a series of timestamped records that are generated whenever an automation fires successfully. By default, the records will be listed in chronological order starting with the most recent record to fire successfully. These records can be useful in many scenarios, such as: to troubleshoot automations that are not firing when expected to verify that actions have occurred as a result of an automation to monitor the progress or activity of an application How to Access the Automation Log The automation log of a program can be accessed from two places: while editing an automation, or from the Automation tab while viewing a program in build mode. To access the log while editing an automation: Access an automation Select View Log To access the log from the Automation tab Navigate to Automations within a program Select View Log Automation Log Tips Searching for Automation Records Use the search bar to input the title of the automation and locate records for a specific automation Try to use search terms that aren't commonly used in titles of other automations If results aren't generated, check the spelling of your search terms or try broadening your search by being less specific Searching for Application Activity Try searching for the application title or the application ID in the search field Search using the applicant's name to pull all records associated with that user Sort the Record Table Select the date column header to update the order in which records are displayed - newest to oldest or vice versa. Cannot Locate a Record Records are only generated when an automation fires successfully. If a record isn't appearing and you believe it should have fired, first check that the automation is active . If active, did the activation occur? Next, review the application material against the conditions . For example, does the automation require that ALL conditions be met, or ANY? Also review the matching parameters of the set rules to ensure they have been set correctly.

You’ll want to add here any merge field information that you have stored in your email provider and want to track, such as name, company name, or email address. To build a link to send with an email provider: From the Survey Link page, select the Other tab. (optional) If you’re adding merge fields for Visualforce, select Visualforce templates from the dropdown. (optional) If you selected Visualforce templates, add any Visualforce merge fields: Select +Visualforce Field . Enter the Merge Field Value . Select Add . Repeat to add more Visualforce fields. Add general merge fields for your email provider: Select +General Field . Enter a merge field name and value. Learn more about merge fields Select Add . Repeat to add more general fields. Don’t use any spaces in the merge field name. For example, use email_address instead of email address, and use first_name or firstname instead of first name . Use this link to send your survey via your own email provider. As people take your survey, each merge field creates a column in your Response tab. This will help you track who the response is from. If you don’t see merge fields come through in your Response tab, make sure your syntax is correct for each merge field.

How to Test your Salesforce Integration,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/test-salesforce-integration/,"How to Test your Salesforce Integration | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Test your Salesforce Integration How to Troubleshoot an ""Unsuccessful"" Sync Required Fields Missing Fuzzy Logic Rules Picklist does not Match How to Troubleshoot a ""Successful"" Sync with Missing Fields Help Advanced Features How to Test your Salesforce Integration Apply How to Test your Salesforce Integration How to Test your Salesforce Integration How to Troubleshoot an ""Unsuccessful"" Sync Required Fields Missing Fuzzy Logic Rules Picklist does not Match How to Troubleshoot a ""Successful"" Sync with Missing Fields How to Test your Salesforce Integration In order to test properly and for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to start from scratch - create a new submission and follow the application process as created in SurveyMonkey Apply. When using your test submission: ✔ Ensure that the Salesforce integration action runs on the specified time (created, edited, submitted, and automated activations) “Submission edited” in the integration will fire on “Submitted”, “Task Completed”, and ""Task Edited"". Changes to a submission such as editing submission metadata and moving the submission from one stage to another do NOT activate the Salesforce action even if it’s on “edited”. ✔ Check the logs found in the Salesforce integration ✔ If using an automation, ensure that it fired by accessing the Automation Logs . ✔ In the logs, select the Arrow on the right side of the log on which the action ran to see more information , such as the fields and the values. This will tell you whether or not the information was collected and pushed/pulled correctly. How to Troubleshoot an ""Unsuccessful"" Sync The status that is given to the record is based on the information that Salesforce sends to Apply. If you receive an unsuccessful status, the Sync Details will typically provide the reason why and in some instances a recommendation to resolve it. Below are a few potential reasons an error may occur: Required Fields Missing A common error may be ""Required fields are missing: [Salesforce Field]"" In order to troubleshoot this type of error: Refer to the Log Details to determine the action that was meant to fire for this submission. Within the Integration page, go to the Action the error occurred for Refer to the Salesforce Field that is detailed in the error Verify what the corresponding Apply Field is Using the submission that received the error, check to make sure that the Apply Field has a response. For example, the Salesforce Field ""CloseDate"" may be linked to the Submittal date of a submission. If you receive the error ""Required fields are missing: [CloseDate]"" it is likely that the submission has not yet been submitted within the site. If this is a common error, you may wish to configure the Action, or the Trigger Sync, to ensure that this action only occurs once the submission has been submitted within the site. Fuzzy Logic Rules Fuzzy logic rules enabled for Salesforce fields can impact the ability to match with an existing contact in Salesforce successfully in order to write the record to it. If a sync record is marked as “unsuccessful” and this is related to fuzzy logic rules, you may find the following error attached to an unsuccessful sync record: “You're creating a duplicate record. We recommend you use an existing record instead.” If Fuzzy Logic is enabled within Salesforce, and you have different submissions within Apply with similar information they could be recognized as the same record in Salesforce. When the change occurs (the name was updated in Salesforce), a manual sync of the failed action can be used to run the action specifically for that submission again. Picklist does not Match Closed Ended questions such as a dropdown in Apply are pushed as a string to SF. This means that the SF field can be a text response, or it can also be a picklist If the Salesforce Field is a text response, ensure the validation allows for the string to be accepted (e.g. check character limits and other validations) If the Salesforce field is a picklist, ensure that the choices within Apply are exactly Matched to the Picklist in Salesforce. How to Troubleshoot a ""Successful"" Sync with Missing Fields In some cases, it is possible that the record will be recorded as ""Successful"" however when you click to view the record details the fields have not be fully populated. If this is the case, the main reason this may occur is because the field what you are pulling from does not contain a response and the field being pushed to is not required. For example, if you are running a Push Action, and have a field in Salesforce that is not required, the Action will still run and be successful, even if the linked SMApply field is blank.

This guide provides you with an overview of how we can work together to ensure we complete your project quickly and efficiently! Discovering your requirements A concise discovery starts with a thorough understanding of what you want your workflow to look like and your requirements as a whole. It starts with identifying your process. Determine your preferred task types (i.e., fill out a form, upload a file) Determine how you’d like to assign reviewers. Apply enables you to assign reviewers to applications in three ways. You can match them up manually, use random distribution or assign reviewers based on business rules. Read through “ What to expect in the Discovery Phase ”. These are the questions we’re going to ask you to understand how to build your site in a way that meets your requirements Document collection and building your scope of work Document collection is a critical part of ensuring we build the site to your requirements. It starts with finalizing your reference materials. Finalize any application forms, recommendation forms, scoring forms, or automated email texts. Make any necessary changes to your scope of work, and return it to your Apply implementation specialist with the documents that you would like built into your site Include details about how you'd like form questions to work (if you have any). For example, you may want a mix of multiple choice questions, drop-down selection, or you may want some questions to be required or optional, or to make use of Apply’s question logic to let applicants skip questions. We'll create a timeline based on the collection phase. Please ensure that the timelines set on this project work with your schedule First Demonstration The first demonstration provides an early opportunity to review a demonstration of your project in action. We’ll provide the demo itself and details on the feedback phase. We’ll record this demo and distribute it to your team after the call to make feedback easier. Tips: Ensure your admin training is complete before the demo. It will ensure you have a thorough understanding of Apply’s administrative interface. Prepare a list of questions you have about how Apply works. It will help us ensure we help you follow best practices and get the most value from your Apply site. Feedback You may not have any feedback and that's okay! We're very focused on helping you succeed and we're great at our jobs! However, it's important to remember that the feedback period takes place only once. We want you to get the most from this phase. Tips: Get your hands dirty; test out your new site.

Fill out the feedback sheet in detail. We’ll provide you with a sheet to complete during this phase with the required details to help us find and recreate any issues. The more specific you are, the more tailored our approach can be! Provide your feedback in time to keep your project on track . We love your feedback! We need it in the timelines you set with your Implementation Specialist to ensure you hit your launch date. Second Demonstration During the second demonstration, we show you the production-ready version of your site. We also cover the changes we made based on your feedback and the launch steps. We record this call just like the first demonstration and share it with your team. At this point, your implementation specialist will have completed all the changes identified during the Feedback Phase. If you need changes down the road, our professional services team can assist further. And, of course, you are always free to make changes to your site on your own at any part of the process, although we recommend that you check with your Implementation Specialist before making changes. It reduces the risk of breaking anything important! Tips: Bask in the glory of your new, beautiful site Use this time to ask any further questions about implementation or how to manage your site once it’s launched Ensure you are comfortable with the steps to launch your site Launch We’re ready to launch! The Launch Phase is a final opportunity to ask any questions you may have about your site and next steps.

Definitions The following are common terms used in an implementation project. Scope of Work: The project details and timelines. Workflow: The path in which an application takes from initiation to completion. The workflow generally includes application, review, accepted, denied. Stage: A step in the workflow. We have 3 types of stages; application, review, holding bucket. An application stage is a collection of tasks that an applicant must complete prior to submitting their application. A review stage is where the assignment between an application to a reviewer is defined and the reviewer’s scoring form is housed. A holding bucket is used primarily for organizing applications (ie. accepted vs. denied) as there are no tasks within. Task: An action item for an applicant, a recommender or a reviewer. A task in Apply can be an online form, a file upload, payment, etc. Triggers/Automations: An action in the system based on a prerequisite. Assignments: The ways in which an application is assigned to a reviewer or team of reviewers. Assignments can be handled by manual matchups, random distribution rules, or automated assignments based on rules (see what is possible here ). Automated Email Text: Any text that you would like to automatically email to users, at any point in your process.

To get the link for your form: Log in and go to Forms . To the right of the form, click the Share icon. Choose between the Permanent Link or Title Link . Copy the link and paste it wherever you'd like. TIP! Below the link on the Share page, you can easily open Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, or your email application to share a link to your form. Permanent Link (Recommended) The Permanent Link for your form contains a unique ID (a string of letters and numbers) that references the form. We recommend using the Permanent Link since it never changes—even if you make edits to your form. Example : https://subdomain.wufoo.com/forms/ r4nd0ml3tt3rs Title Link The Title Link (previously called the Short Link) for your form contains the title of the form instead of a unique ID. This is considered a friendly link since it's easy to read and includes words that are relevant to your form. Example : If your form's title is ""Pizza Palace Order Form"", your Title Link would be: https://subdomain.wufoo.com/forms/ pizza-palace-order-form If you edit your form's title, the Title Link updates to match. This means the old Title Link will no longer work, so you'll need to send the new Title Link to anyone you shared the old one with. Your Subdomain You'll notice the Permanent Link and Title Link for any forms in your account contain your subdomain .

How to Set Up Registration,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/features/registration-setup/,"How to Set Up Registration | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Access the Registration Settings Applicant Registration Registration Instructions Advanced Options How Registration Works in SM Apply Help Features and Settings Registration How to Set Up Registration Apply How to Set Up Registration How to Access the Registration Settings Applicant Registration Registration Instructions Advanced Options How Registration Works in SM Apply After your programs have been built and you have completed testing, you will be ready to start accepting applications. This article will walk through how to set up applicant registration to meet your needs. NOTE: Reviewers need to be manually added and recommenders will need to be sent a request by applicants within the site. How to Access the Registration Settings To access Registration: Select the Settings menu Click Registration Applicant Registration There are two different options available when enabling Applicant Registration within your site: Invite-only applicant registration This is useful if you wish to set up a private application process where only select applicants are able to register. It will allow you to Add Users and Invite Users to the site and they will be able to register. Allow any site visitor to register as an applicant This option is most commonly used as it allows anyone with access to the homepage of the site to register and create an account. Additionally, you can Enable a Registration Period which will allow you to automatically open and close your site registration on a specific date and time. Registration Instructions Provide instructions to your applicants while they are registering for the site. These instructions will appear at the top of the Registration Form to assist them with registration. There is a character limit of 250 characters (including spaces). TIP! Use this field to provide guidance on who should register for your site and any potential registration dates. More extensive information about your site can be written on the Homepage of your site. Advanced Options By default your site is set up with SurveyMonkey Apply login and registration, however, you may wish for applicants to be able to login to the site using your organization's login credentials. This can be done using one of our Single Sign-On (SSO) methods. The SSO Methods available are: SAML CAS OAuth How Registration Works in SM Apply When a user registers to a SurveyMonkey Apply site, whether it is as an applicant, recommender, reviewer, or even as an administrator, an account is created for them within the SM Apply database. However, registration is site-specific . Therefore even if the user has an account within SM Apply they will need to re-register for your site. When registering they will simply need to ensure that the password that they enter and confirm matches the password that exists within SM Apply . If necessary, they will also be able to reset their password during this process. Once they have been registered, an account will be created for them within your site and they will be able to login in the future. If a password is reset for the profile, the updated password will be applied to all sites where the profile exists. If your applicants have any questions in regards to this process, you can also refer them to our Applicant FAQ: How do I register for a site?

Salesforce Merge Fields,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-merge-fields/,"Salesforce Merge Fields | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Before You Start Adding Merge Fields to Survey Links Sending Surveys Using Salesforce Mapping Merge Fields to Salesforce Using Encrypted Merge Fields Help Salesforce Salesforce Merge Fields GetFeedback Salesforce Merge Fields Before You Start Adding Merge Fields to Survey Links Sending Surveys Using Salesforce Mapping Merge Fields to Salesforce Using Encrypted Merge Fields Essentials feature : Available on Essentials, Pro, and Ultimate plans. By default, GetFeedback doesn't track your survey recipient addresses, or identify who is clicking on a GetFeedback survey link. If you want to track respondent details and match survey responses with known contacts, leads, or opportunities, add merge fields to your survey link. Merge fields can pull in data from Salesforce to create a unique URL for each respondent. When someone uses the link to complete the survey, we’ll track their responses using the merge fields in your survey link. If you’re sending a survey from Salesforce, you can either add merge fields to the survey link or to your GetFeedback email template. If you’re creating a custom template to send from Salesforce, you’ll need to add merge fields to your survey link manually. We'll add the merge fields to your survey for you when you set up a Visualforce or HTML email or use our automated email builder . Before You Start Make sure to set up Salesforce Custom Mappings or Managed Mappings before you send your survey. Adding Merge Fields to Survey Links If you build your email outside of GetFeedback, you'll need to manually add merge fields to your survey link (for example, when you create a custom email template in Salesforce). When adding merge fields to your survey link, follow the proper syntax outlined by GetFeedback and utilize proper Salesforce merge fields. The image below shows how to format a link. This example includes Salesforce merge field syntax in the merge field value section of the link. The merge field pulls in the respondent’s data when they go to your survey link. Examples Here's an example of a generic survey link that pulls in the respondent’s Contact ID and first name. Salesforce pulls in a recipient’s contact ID and first name when you send the email. When the respondent uses the unique link to complete the survey, GetFeedback pulls the merge field data from the link to associate it with the response. www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?ContactID={!Contact.Id}&FirstName={!FirstName} Here's an example of how the template link above may look after it is sent to a Salesforce Contact. When the respondent clicks the link, GetFeedback pulls the merge field values from the link and places the values in the results table on your survey results page. www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?ContactID=0030X000001XXXX&FirstName=Tym Sending Surveys Using Salesforce There are many ways to send surveys using Salesforce. You can add merge fields using our tools, and we’ll format the link for you. You can use the following methods to send surveys with Salesforce: Create a Visualforce template to send from Salesforce. Use our Salesforce email automation to build an email template, outbound message, and workflow in Salesforce. Send from GetFeedback using a Salesforce Report . Show a survey after a Salesforce Chat . Mapping Merge Fields to Salesforce Once you've added merge fields, you can map this information into Salesforce along with the associated answer information. To map a merge field to Salesforce: Take and fully submit your survey , using the merge fields you want to map to Salesforce. Since merge fields can have any name, this step allows GetFeedback to know which merge fields you'll be mapping and gives you a chance to test out your distribution URL. Once you've done this, you should see those merge fields in your survey response table. The example image below uses the Name and Email Address merge fields at the end of the survey link: After submitting your survey, go to the survey builder in GetFeedback. Select Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings to set up your mappings . When you select the item you want to map, choose to Map a merge field , then select the fields you want to map. After setting up your mappings, test your survey to make sure your mappings and merge fields work correctly. Using Encrypted Merge Fields By default, respondents can view the merge field data in the survey link. For example, if you use the Contact ID merge field, your respondents can see their Contact ID in the link when they take your survey. Respondents may also be able to manipulate or remove merge fields from your survey link. You can encrypt merge fields to hide personal data from your survey respondents and prevent them from changing the link.

Payment Options,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/account/payment-options/,"Payment Options | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Sales Tax Find your GetFeedback Invoice (Legacy or Standalone Plans) Help Account Management Your account Payment Options GetFeedback Payment Options Sales Tax Find your GetFeedback Invoice (Legacy or Standalone Plans) GetFeedback accepts different methods of payment depending on the plan you've signed up for. Legacy (standalone) GetFeedback plans pay by credit card on their Settings > Payment & Pricing page. Other plan types, such as the GetFeedback CX or GetFeedback for Salesforce plans receive a monthly or annual invoice. If you do business in a state that has sales tax, and GetFeedback maintains a physical presence in that state, your GetFeedback subscription may be subject to sales tax, this information will be on your plan invoice. If you're subscribed to a GetFeedback CX plan, and you've lost track of your invoice, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager, Account Executive, or the GetFeedback support Sales Tax If you do business in a state with sales tax, and GetFeedback maintains a physical presence in that state, your GetFeedback subscription may be subject to sales tax. You can find the dollar value of the sales tax collected at the bottom of your plan invoice. Why am I only being charged sales tax now? A recent supreme court case has changed the US sales tax landscape for many out-of-state sellers. The case expanded the sales tax nexus to include economic/digital nexus for sellers that do not have a physical presence in the taxing state. (case citation: 585 U.S 17-494) This change has prompted many technology companies providing Software as a Service (SaaS) to review the states in which they have a sales tax nexus. GetFeedback has a legal obligation to collect and remit sales tax from customers who consume our services in states that are subject to sales tax. From June 1, 2019, in states where we include sales tax on your invoice, you will no longer be required to remit use tax to the state in respect of our services. This removes any use tax liability and compliance burden from you. If I'm currently not required to pay sales tax, could that change in the future? Yes. If GetFeedback has a physical presence in a state, sales tax nexus may apply. Sales tax would then be applied to invoices from the date a physical presence commenced. As the digital economy continues to grow, we expect the number of states that charge sales tax on SaaS transactions will increase. We will always let you know of any changes to how we charge you. What happens if I don't provide my zip code? Zip code disclosure is a requirement for all active accounts. If you pay for your GetFeedback plan by credit card, you can update your billing information by navigating to Account Settings > Plan & Payment. When did you start charging sales tax? We began charging sales tax in applicable states on June 1, 2019. Find your GetFeedback Invoice (Legacy or Standalone Plans) For all other plans, your invoice will be sent to the billing contact email address we have on file.

Advanced Analysis Features We have specialized analysis features to help you understand your customer's habits better. If you want to use these features, there are certain things to keep in mind when designing your survey. Key Driver Analysis Key Drivers allow you to choose an outcome metric and then see which attitudes and behaviors of your customers have the highest correlation with that outcome. For example, you could choose the outcome metric of purchase intent then see data points about what drives people to purchase. Setting Up Your Survey to Use Key Drivers The only question type compatible with Key Drivers is the Multiple Choice question . How you set it up depends on what you want to analyze: Outcome metrics use a multiple choice question with 2-7 answer choices. Data points are created from multiple choice questions with the same number of answer choices as the outcome metric. Example If you want to know how often people will use your product, set up a multiple choice question with 5 answer options asking people about frequency of use. Frequency of use would be your outcome metric. Then, any other multiple choice questions in your survey with 5 answer options will show as data points when determining how often people want to use your product. For example, one of these questions could ask people on a 5 point scale how innovative they find your products. This shows as a data point for the frequency of use outcome metric in Key Drivers. Data points create a chart that helps you correlate how these affect each other. Using the example above, you would be able to see how frequency of use changes depending on how innovative people find your product. Viewing Key Drivers in Analyze When you're ready to Analyze your data: Go to the Analyze section of your project. Click the dropdown menu on the right side of the page and select Key Drivers . Click the blue text above the chart to choose your settings. Choose your outcome variable from the dropdown and preferred chart scale. Click Save . To see our recommendations based on this outcome metric, click the Insights icon above the chart. AI Powered Insights AI insights help you understand your data by recommending filters that significantly change the question distribution.

Only displays insights that have 95% significance (0.05 p-value). Checkbox Significant changes to the answer distributions. Filter sets that most significantly change the answer option distribution. How insights are calculated Calculations depend on question type: Multiple choice questions use a one-tailed z-proportion test with 95% confidence interval to recommend filters that generate the largest difference in answer distributions.

Because our paid services are primarily intended for use by businesses and professional users, your account type is set as Business by default. Team and Enterprise accounts are always considered Business accounts. However, if you have a paid, individual plan and you are primarily using our service for personal, family or household purposes, we ask that you log in to your account and update your account type to Consumer (Personal) so that we may better understand such personal use of our platform and services. Changing Your Account Type First, in the Account Details section of the My Account page, click Edit next to Business in the Account type field. Then, on the Account type screen, select the Consumer (Personal) option, and click Save . Ownership of Accounts The owner of your account and the data in it depends on your plan type listed in the Account Details section of the My Account page. Enterprise and Team Plans If you have an Enterprise or Team account, we regard the organization to be the owner of the team and all the accounts on that team. This makes it easier for organizations to ensure they retain ownership and control of all surveys and survey data contained in the User, Admin, and Primary Admin accounts. SurveyMonkey doesn’t claim ownership of the survey questions your organization creates or responses it collects through its accounts. The organization, or a verified representative of it, is responsible for payment obligations and has the ability to manage all the team's accounts—even if that representative is not an account holder. Individual Plans If you have an individual plan and have not joined a team, the email address listed in My Account is considered the sole owner of, and is accountable for, the account and information created and collected using our system. If your email address is a work email address, then your organization will be considered accountable for the account and information created and collected using our system.

This allows you to quickly identify, remove and change the question or pages affected by these features. Hovering over the badges will show a tooltip indicating what feature they're representing. If you click on the badge, it'll jump you to the feature in the interface. Page Skip Logic Applied Page Randomization Applied Question Skip Logic Applied Quota Applied Question Randomization Applied Notifications In the lower right hand corner, we'll pop up information, messages and statuses on communication happening between your browser and our servers. These notifications are used to both let you know when data is being transmitted or received. If an error occurs, you'll see it show up in red and persist on the screen. You can reference some of the most common error messages and what they mean in the Errors section at the bottom of this page. Warnings The following messages are shown when we detect that you've made a change that might cause an adverse affect on your survey. CIRCULAR LOGIC This warning display because the Question Skip Logic you've implemented causes a page to redirect to a question on the same page. Please note that question logic only executes when the user hits the Next button at the end of the page. EDITING CERTIFIED QUESTIONS The use of some SurveyMonkey features results in the loss of certification for questions added from our Question Bank Library . If you edit the wording of a question or how the answer choices are presented, it'll no longer be certified, which means it might be subject to bias and accuracy issues. This will also cause the Question Bank-certified badge disappear from the question. Parts of certain Certified Questions can be customized if you see dropdowns in the question text. Clicking on those words will give you alternative options that can better fit the context of your survey. Limitations The following messages are shown when changes to the survey or question will limit the features you can use. RESPONSES COLLECTED: Changes to this question will be limited. Because this question has collected responses, the changes you can make to this question will be limited to help preserve the integrity of the data already collected. For example, you will only be able to hide certain answer options rather than delete them. CHOICES ADDED: Save this question to apply logic to recently added answers. The choices you've recently added to the question weren't saved before you switched to the logic tab. Until you save the question, the new answer choices will not be available in the Question Skip Logic settings. You'll need to save the question and then edit it again to use the new answer choices in your skip logic. QUOTA APPLIED: Changes to this question will be limited. Because a quota was created that references this question, the changes you can make to this question will be limited to help preserve the integrity of the quota. For example, you will only be able to hide certain answer options rather than delete them. LOGIC APPLIED: Changes to this question will be limited. Because this question has question logic associated with it, the changes you can make to this question will be limited to help preserve the integrity of logic. For example, you will only be able to hide certain answer options rather than delete them. LOGIC APPLIED : This survey has skip logic in it. Therefore, only the percentage complete can be displayed. If you apply page skip logic or question skip logic to your survey, the number of pages complete will be hidden from the progress bar.

Measuring Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with Salesforce,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-measure-csat/,"Measuring Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with Salesforce | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Calculating CSAT Scores Measuring CSAT with Salesforce Help Salesforce Measuring Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with Salesforce GetFeedback Measuring Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with Salesforce Calculating CSAT Scores Measuring CSAT with Salesforce GetFeedback makes it easy to measure customer satisfaction with the CSAT question. CSAT helps you understand a customer’s experience with a specific interaction or experience, such as contacting support or making a purchase. You can use CSAT scores to coach your employees, improve transaction experiences, and more. You can use CSAT with other metrics to understand the full customer experience with your brand. This guide helps you calculate and report your CSAT scores in Salesforce. Use these formulas to calculate the CSAT score from your GetFeedback surveys and build reports and dashboards in Salesforce. Calculating CSAT Scores GetFeedback calculates CSAT as a percentage of satisfied responses (people who selected 4 or 5). Satisfied scores are a more accurate predictor of customer retention. To calculate CSAT score: Take the number of respondents who answered 4 and 5. Divide that number by the total number of survey responses. Multiply by 100 to see the percentage of satisfied customers. The formula for CSAT scores looks like this: (Number of satisfied customers (4 and 5) / Number of survey responses) x 100 = % of satisfied customers Example : 500 people responded to a CSAT survey. 68 were Very Satisfied (score 5), and 74 were Somewhat Satisfied (score 4). Add the number of Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses to get 142. Divide 142 by the total number of responses (500). You get .284 . Multiply .284 by 100 to get 28.4%. This is your CSAT score. The equation would look like this: (142 / 500) x 100 = 28.4% Measuring CSAT with Salesforce You can track CSAT scores in Salesforce to include them in dashboards and reports. There are a few steps to complete to set up CSAT in Salesforce: Create your CSAT survey Create a CSAT object in Salesforce Map your survey to the CSAT object Add merge fields to your survey Create a CSAT Survey Create a GetFeedback survey with a CSAT question. You can use a template or build a survey from scratch. You can also use Quick Launch to quickly build a CSAT survey that integrates with Salesforce. Create a CSAT Object in Salesforce Create a custom object to hold CSAT responses from your survey. You’ll use Salesforce Custom Mappings to send survey responses to this object. When creating your CSAT object: Name the object after your survey so you can recognize the object - for example, “Case Closed CSAT.” Include a field for every survey question/answer you want to map to Salesforce. Include a field for each merge field in your survey. Set Up Mappings In GetFeedback , map your survey to the CSAT object you created in Salesforce. Use our custom mapping tool to send survey responses to your custom object and fields. Some survey questions can only be mapped to certain Salesforce field types. Learn more Add Merge Fields To track who sent a response, you can add merge fields. Merge fields pull in data from Salesforce when someone opens your survey, such as their Contact or Account ID. Merge fields also help Salesforce know where to map data to. The way you add merge fields depends on how you send your survey: Sending automated emails from GetFeedback : You’ll add merge fields while setting up your email automation. Sending to a list using a Salesforce report : You’ll add merge fields to each contact in your list. Sending emails directly from Salesforce : You’ll need to add merge fields to the survey link using our Salesforce link builder . Learn more about merge fields Send Your Survey You can now send your survey to respondents. When someone takes your survey, their response will be mapped to Salesforce. You can set up dashboards and reports in Salesforce with the data you mapped from your survey. Create Salesforce Reports and Group Responses If you create reports in Salesforce, you can group customers by CSAT score. You can use this data to quickly find unsatisfied customers. When you create your report in Salesforce, calculate the overall CSAT score using this formula: ((CSAT_Survey__c.CSAT__c:AVG)/5)*100 Your survey respondents will be grouped by score on the report.

Types of Themes in the Theme Library You can choose from themes in a few categories: Theme Type Description Standard Themes Standard themes are basic, pre-designed themes anyone can apply to your survey to change the overall the look and feel. You may need a paid plan to customize it further. My Themes These are Standard Themes you customized or generated. When you create a custom theme , it's saved in My Themes so you can use it again in the future on any of your other surveys. Premium Themes Premium themes are pre-designed themes that use advanced customization features. Team Themes Team themes are themes that have been customized and saved to your team's Library . Primary Admins and Admins can add themes to the Library to share them with every member of their team. If your team has added a CSS theme, you’ll find it here. Creating Your Own Themes There are a few ways to build your own theme: Generate a theme from an image : Use our theme generator to build a custom theme based on an image, like your company’s logo. Create a custom theme : Manually create your own custom theme. Anyone can create a custom theme and preview it on a survey.

Salesforce: How to Prepare,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/salesforce-prep/,"Salesforce: How to Prepare | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Salesforce: Overview The ""WHAT"" The ""WHO"" The ""HOW"" Help Advanced Features Salesforce: How to Prepare Apply Salesforce: How to Prepare Salesforce: Overview The ""WHAT"" The ""WHO"" The ""HOW"" Salesforce: Overview Salesforce is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool and it can house large amounts of information. The information in Salesforce is often required within SurveyMonkey Apply in order to fulfill a client’s procedural requirements. Similarly, information in SM Apply is often required to be sent back to Salesforce. Currently, the integration only allows for application-based information. When an application is created, Applicant Custom Fields can be pushed or pulled. Therefore, you will not be able to pull information from an Eligibility Form in the site. Information is collected within SM Apply in the way of creating, editing or submitting an application. This information can be mapped to the corresponding Salesforce field in the form of a “Push” action in our integration. This allows for a client to gain access to the fields that are most important to them from within their Salesforce environment, without having to access SM Apply. If you already have information on the applicant housed in Salesforce, we can PULL this into their SM Apply application, potentially eliminating the need for the applicants to re-enter the information. The ""WHAT"" This integration allows your organization to exchange information between Salesforce and SurveyMonkey Apply. To get started, ask yourself: What type of data needs to be exchanged? Applicant information? Recommender information? Reviewer information? What type of fields are being sent from Salesforce? SM Apply supports data from standard objects and custom objects. The ""WHO"" SM Apply facilitates the setup of the integration; however, a member of your organization will be responsible for configuration and mapping. The integration is established using one set of Salesforce login credentials that belong to your Salesforce environment. To get started, ask yourself: Do I have a general Salesforce admin login? [hint: you’ll need one] Who initially configured my company’s Salesforce environment? [colleague or 3rd party?] Is the person responsible for the integration familiar with my company’s Salesforce environment? The ""HOW"" Information can either be PULLED into SM Apply or PUSHED out to Salesforce. In order for this to occur, the fields in SM Apply should match those in Salesforce. To get started, ask yourself: What information needs to be PULLED into SM Apply? What information needs to be PUSHED to Salesforce?

Salesforce V4: Overview,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/salesforce-v4-overview/,"Salesforce V4: Overview | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is Salesforce? What information can you sync? Help Advanced Features Salesforce V4: Overview Apply Salesforce V4: Overview What is Salesforce? What information can you sync? What is Salesforce? Salesforce is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool and it can house large amounts of information. The information in Salesforce is often required within Apply in order to fulfill a client’s procedural requirements. Similarly, information in Apply is often required to be sent back to Salesforce. What information can you sync? Currently, the integration supports the flow of data between systems for the following objects in SurveyMonkey Apply: Organizations (push to Salesforce only) Users Applicants Collaborators Recommenders Reviewers Administrators Applications Recommendations (push to Salesforce only) Reviews (push to Salesforce only) The integration supports the following Salesforce fields: String Text area Email Boolean Int Double (Floating point number) Date Date/time Time Phone URL Picklist Information is collected within Apply in the way of creating, editing, or submitting a submission, updating a user or organization profile, and completing a review or recommendation. This information can be mapped to the corresponding Salesforce field in the form of a PUSH action in our integration. This allows for a client to gain access to the fields that are most important to them from within their Salesforce environment, without having to access Apply. If your client already has information on the applicant housed in their Salesforce, we can PULL this into their Apply submission or user profile, potentially eliminating the need for the applicants to re-enter the information. Data from Salesforce cannot be pulled into the following Apply objects: recommendation, reviews, and organization profiles. SM Apply supports data from standard objects and custom objects.

Log in Sign up free Add another layer of security to your SurveyMonkey account by using two-factor authentication (2FA) when logging in. 2FA uses two types of authentication factors to identify who you are when logging into your account: Authentication factor What does this mean? Examples 1. Knowledge Something you know Your login info: email address and password 2. Possession Something you have *A smartphone, or tablet * Any device that can download an authenticator app. When 2FA is enabled, you need both your login information and a one-time passcode generated by an authenticator app on your mobile device to log in to your account. If your SurveyMonkey account is linked to Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft, or Apple and you use those credentials to log in or you're part of an Enterprise team with Single Sign-On (SSO) set up—You'll not be able to use 2FA. Before You Start To set up and use 2FA, you need to have an authenticator app downloaded on your mobile device. Here are some common authenticator apps that can be found in your mobile device app store: Google Authenticator LastPass Authenticator Microsoft Authenticator Setting Up Two-factor Authentication (2FA) Getting set up with 2FA is a two-step process. First you turn 2FA on for your SurveyMonkey account, and then you register the mobile device you'll use to verify your identity. Turning on 2FA: Log in and go to My Account . Find the Profile section. Go to the Login Details page from the Login details section. Turn the toggle on to enable 2FA. To complete setting up 2FA you need an authenticator app on your mobile device. Setting up your 2FA mobile device: Once your account has 2FA turned on, you can now connect your mobile device. Select, Yes continue to setup . Open the authenticator app on your mobile device to scan the QR code. Enter the code. Click on Continue . Your mobile device is now saved for 2FA, and will be used to confirm your identity using the authenticator app when you next log in. If you have issue with setting up, read more about troubleshooting 2FA. TIP! Codes may have a countdown to expiry which will invalidate the code. Check to make sure you enter the most current code. You can choose to remember this device for 30 days when logging in. So when you next log in with the same device or browser, it will remember this device and you won't be asked for a code for the next 30 days. Managing Your 2FA Device You may need to switch which mobile device you use for 2FA. For example, if you get a new phone or tablet. Read more about troubleshooting 2FA .

(optional) Remove the SurveyMonkey account from the Authenticator app. Two-factor authentication is now turned off for your account. If you want to use 2FA again, toggle it back on. Troubleshooting 2FA You may need to check with your chosen authenticator app for any other troubleshooting issues. I'm having trouble scanning the QR code To set up your device with 2FA, you first need to open the authenticator app on your mobile device to scan the QR code. This may look different on each authenticator app–reach out to their guide or Help Center for further instructions. Trouble scanning? If you're unable to scan the QR code with the authenticator app then: Click Trouble scanning? Enter the code generated into your authenticator app Your authenticator app will provide a code to enter into the 2FA set up. Click Continue . TIP!

Matrix/Rating Scale Question,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/matrix-rating-scale/,"Matrix/Rating Scale Question | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview Creating a Matrix/Rating Scale Question Survey Behavior Analyzing Results Help Creating Surveys Ranking & Rating Questions Matrix/Rating Scale Question SurveyMonkey Matrix/Rating Scale Question Video Overview Creating a Matrix/Rating Scale Question Survey Behavior Analyzing Results Matrix Question Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free A Matrix question is a closed-ended question that asks respondents to evaluate one or more row items using the same set of column choices. A Rating Scale question, commonly known as a Likert Scale, is a variation of the Matrix question where you can assign weights to each answer choice. Rating Scales automatically calculate a weighted average for each answer choice in the Analyze Results section. Video Overview Creating a Matrix/Rating Scale Question TIP! Keep column choices short, and avoid creating too many rows and columns. Large matrices may cause respondents to speed through their answers just to get past the question more quickly. To add this question type: Drag and drop Matrix/Rating Scale into your survey from the Build section of the sidebar. In the Rows fields, enter the items you want respondents to evaluate. In the Columns fields, enter the measurements you want respondents to use to evaluate the row items. Column choices should be applicable to every row item and are necessary for analysis. Configure any additional options. Click Save . Make This a Single-Row Rating Scale (Remove Row Choices) Selecting this option does three things at once: Removes the Row fields. You will only have to enter question text and Column Choices. Applies the Use Weights option so a weighted average will be calculated in the Analyze Results section. Enables the option to add Question Skip Logic to skip respondents to a future point in the survey based on their answer choice. Allow Multiple Responses per Row (Use Checkboxes) Use checkboxes to allow respondents to select more than one answer choice per row. Use Weights Assign a weight to each column, transforming the question into a Rating Scale or Likert Scale question with multiple rows. Add an N/A column : Add a column of ""N/A"" options that respondents can select if none of the other options apply to them. The answers from respondents that select the N/A option will not be factored into calculating the rating average. This option will only appear if you use weights. Forced Ranking (one response per column) Only allow respondents to select one choice per column. This asks respondents to compare the row choices to each other, similar to a Ranking question . This option will only appear if you only allow one response per row. Additional Options Under the Edit , Options , and Logic tabs, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Add an ""Other"" Answer Option for Comments Require an answer , and define a specific range or limit of rows that the respondent must answer Change the question size & layout Sort, randomize, or flip rows Add question skip logic, only if Make this a single-row rating scale is selected Add question & answer piping Learn more: Editing Questions Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. Survey Behavior Depending on the respondent's screen size, large Matrix/Rating Scale questions with many columns may require respondents to scroll to the right to see all of the available column choices. Keeping Matrix/Rating Scale questions short and simple can improve completion rates. Read more about the impact of question types on mobile vs. non-mobile completion rates on our blog: How to Keep Your Survey Respondents Happy on Mobile If you require respondents to answer a specific number or range of rows, make sure you customize the error message to reflect the requirement, so respondents will know how to answer the question correctly. If you selected Forced ranking (one response per column) , respondents will only be able to apply each column choice to one row item. If a respondent tries to select the same column choice for another row, their previous selection will disappear. Analyzing Results Your results will be presented in a table with the questions or statements listed down the first column, and the answer choices listed across the first row. See example results (English only) » Average Rating If you enabled the Use Weights or Make this a single-row rating scale option when you created the question, you'll also see the average rating for each question or statement you asked respondents to evaluate. If needed, you can change the weight of each answer choice in the Design section of the survey, even after the survey has collected responses. The rating average is calculated as follows, where: w = weight of answer choice x = response count for answer choice ( x 1 w 1 + x 2 w 2 + x 3 w 3 ... xnwn ) / Total If you chose to include an N/A column on your Rating Scale question, any N/A responses will not factor into the weighted average. Example For this example, we'll use a 5-point rating scale question. The weights assigned to each answer choices are shown in parentheses: Responsibilities are shared fairly among your team members. Strongly Disagree (1) Disagree (2) Neither Agree nor Disagree (3) Agree (4) Strongly Agree (5) After collecting responses to the survey, the results will look something like this. Strongly Disagree Disagree Neither Agree nor Disagree Agree Strongly Agree Total Average Rating Responsibilities are shared fairly among your team members. 20.45% 9 27.27% 12 20.45% 9 11.36% 5 20.45% 9 44 2.84 The average rating of 2.84 indicates that the average sentiment among respondents is that responsibilities are not shared fairly among their team members. The average rating was calculated as follows: (9*1) + (12*2) + (9*3) + (5*4) + (9*5) / 44 125/44 = 2.84 Charts The Depth display option allows you to choose between the following options: Weighted Average : Charts the average rating for each answer choice. Distribution : Charts the absolute number or percentage of respondents that selected each answer choice. The chart types available depend on the question type, and the display options you configure.

One-touch Surveys,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/email-embed/,"One-touch Surveys | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Before You Start Embedding Direct (app.getfeedback.com) Surveys Embedding Digital (app.usabilla.com) Surveys Help Survey channels Email One-touch Surveys GetFeedback One-touch Surveys Before You Start Embedding Direct (app.getfeedback.com) Surveys Embedding Digital (app.usabilla.com) Surveys Essentials feature: Available on Essentials, Pro, and Ultimate plans. One-touch surveys help you raise response rates by embedding survey questions directly in an email. Once a respondent answers the embedded question, the rest of the survey, or a thank you page, displays in their browser. You can either create an embedded email survey or manually embed a question in your email. The instructions change depending on which product you're using. Before You Start To embed GetFeedback Digital (app.usabilla.com) surveys, you'll need access to your email signatures. Embedding Direct (app.getfeedback.com) Surveys GetFeedback's one click email embed feature lets you embed a survey question directly into your email as a button or hide it behind a hyperlink. Using app.getfeedback.com , you can embed the following question types in an email: Rating Net Promoter Score (NPS) Like/Dislike Multiple choice If you’d rather let GetFeedback create an email template for you, you can export an HTML email template with a survey question embedded. Getting Started First, build your app.getfeedback.com survey, then remove the title page. For one click embedded surveys, we recommend creating a survey with only one question so the survey is automatically submitted when respondents answer the embedded question. Creating Links for Your HTML Template You need to create links for each answer option in the question you want to embed in your email. From the survey editor, select the question to embed. In the right panel, select Copy Embed Link . In your HTML email builder, paste the embed link for each possible answer type. It will look something like this: https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]= In this example, we use a NPS question., Because NPS questions have eleven different response options, you’ll want to create eleven different links, one foreach possible answer to your NPS question (0-10). Add an = symbol, then the number of the answer value. Repeat this for each link in your email. Each question type has different values. For example, for the NPS question, add =0 to the end of the first link. https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=0 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=1 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=2 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=3 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=4 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=5 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=6 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=7 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=8 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=9 https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=10 You can add images to your links in your HTML email template, such as button icons. If you need images for your response option buttons, we recommend checking out Material Icons to download some. These instructions work the same way for a Rating question- grab the embed url on the right-hand menu in your survey and assign the unique value to each URL. Your HTML will look a bit like this: <a href="" https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxx?gf_q[8571]=0""> <img src=""imagelinkfor0"" alt=""0""> </a> The code sample above specifically creates the image for the ""0"" answer choice in an NPS question. If someone selects this image in your survey email, the survey will automatically submit a response of 0. If your question has eleven possible answers (like an NPS question, with answer options 0-10), you'll have eleven pieces of HTML like the above, one for each answer. Embedding a Like/Dislike Question The values of Like/Dislike questions are: Like : 1 Example: https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429033]=1 Neutral : 0 Example: https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429033]=0 Dislike : -1 Example: https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429033]=-1 Embedding a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Question The values for Customer Satisfaction questions are 1-5 (1 being the worst, 5 being the best). Example: Very Unsatisfied - https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429034]= 1 Unsatisfied - https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429034]= 2 Neutral - https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429034]= 3 Satisfied - https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429034]= 4 Very Satisfied - https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_q[6429034]= 5 Embedding Multiple Choice Questions When embedding multiple choice questions, you can get a formatted link from GetFeedback for each answer option. From the survey question, select Get Embed Links . Select the answer you want to copy the link for. Paste your link into your email. Repeat for each answer option. If you embed a multiple choice question where users can select more than one option, a window will pop up after the respondent picks an answer to let them choose additional answers. Setting up an HTML Email Template in Salesforce If you use Salesforce, you can set up your embedded survey link using an HTML template in Salesforce. In the example below, we've already added text and code for button images into the email template alongside the code for the button images. Paste the embed link into the HTML email template. Add the value to the link. Copy and paste the images you want to use as buttons into the email. Repeat these steps for all five rating question options. When you’re happy with your template, select Save . Embedding Digital (app.usabilla.com) Surveys Embed a web survey question directly into your email as an image, button, or hyperlink. You can embed a Mood,NPS, Rating, Single Choice (radio buttons) or a Multiple Choice (checkbox) question. Types of Embedded Emails When creating an embedded email campaign, you can choose between Individual and Group Campaigns. Individual Campaign : gather feedback for a single purpose, such as automated or confirmation emails. All feedback from this campaign displays on a single trendline, regardless of where you embed the campaign. Group Campaign : Collect feedback across multiple sub campaigns. Each copy of the embedded campaign has its own trendline, feedback, statistics, and tracking. You can compare the feedback from each campaign to compare success. Group Campaigns work well for newsletters, support agent emails, and email tests (A/B testing, etc.). Use Campaigns to Create Email Widgets To embed a survey widget: In app.usabilla.com , select Websites in the top left corner, then select Email . Select Setup , then select Create New Widget . Select either Individual Campaign or Group Campaign . Name your campaign at the top of the screen. Choose the rating scale to use. Select an introduction, or enter your own custom text. To store your respondents’ IP addresses or location, check the Store IP addresses or Store user location boxes. Select Next to start customizing your form. Customize your form. You can add new form controls (questions), edit and rearrange existing questions, or delete form questions. To change the form based on the response, set the Conditional Forms toggle to on . To change the form appearance, select an option for Custom Theme . Select Next to edit your survey’s exit screen. (Optional) Edit your form’s exit screen. Select Save to finish creating your campaign. Place your campaign in your email using one of the following options: Paste the form into an email Paste the HTML code for the form into an email, email signature, or HTML template Copy the direct link to the form Embed Your Widget After saving your widget, you can embed it in your email. If you need to embed your widget later, you can access these instructions from the Setup page. To get the embed instructions: In app.usabilla.com , go to the Email product. Select Setup. Find your widget in the list. Select Widget installation instructions. Copy and paste the widget HTML code, or survey link in your email. Embed a Usabilla for Web Survey If you don't have access to Usabilla for Email, you can embed a web campaign into your email. Follow the instructions below to embed a web campaign. Create a Full screen survey You need a link for a Full screen survey to embed in your email. We'll set up the survey as a manual link so the button doesn’t show on your website. In app.usabilla.com for web, go to the Campaigns section and select Overview . Select New Campaign . Select Full screen survey . Select a button, then create your survey. When you reach the User Targeting section, select Don’t show survey. Use manual link instead . After saving the survey, go to Overview and select the survey to view and copy the link. Create the links for each answer option Once you've built your survey, go to Overview and select the form to view and copy the link. Then, you need to start adding certain variables to the link so when a user selects a link or form option from your email, the Mood rating they selected in the email will be prefilled. You'll need to customize the copied link for each answer option. To make this work, add the following string to the end of your survey URL: ?reset&prefill_<IDENTIFIER>=<VALUE> The identifier refers to the question type. The identifier of the Mood rating element is mood . The value refers to the answer options. In the case of Mood ratings, the value is a number between 1 and 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. The reset keyword lets a user fill out the same survey multiple times. If you don't want the same user to fill out the survey more than once, remove the reset keyword and the & symbol behind it. 5-scale mood rating For a 5-scale Mood Rating, you'll have 5 separate links. Here's an example link for each of the 5 options: http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=1 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=2 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=3 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=4 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=5 2-scale mood rating You also have an option to use a 2-scale or 3-scale Mood rating. In the case of a 2-scale one, you'll need to use the lowest and highest score as the values: http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=1 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=5 3-scale mood rating In the case of a 3-scale one, you'll need to use the lowest and highest, as well as the middle score as the values: http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=1 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=3 http://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/619ab9821708f11b106f485e?reset&prefill_mood=5 Add the links to your email You're free to use the links you created in any way you'd like in your email—you can attach it to custom images or links of your choice.

In-page surveys on your articles can help you learn what content is performing well and what pages may need improvements. We track the page or article title with any responses that people leave. GetFeedback automatically collects some Salesforce information about your users. We'll store Username, User ID, Contact ID and Current page when the survey is completed so you can map that information back to your Salesforce org. Merge fields can’t be added to surveys using the GetFeedback Lightning component. If you want to add merge fields to your survey, use an overlay survey instead. Before You Start Download the free GetFeedback lightning component from AppExchange. Remove the title page from your survey if you want to show the first question in your Community. If you leave the title page on your survey, the title page displays in your Community instead of a survey question.

Encrypting Merge Fields,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/builder/encrypting-merge-fields/,"Encrypting Merge Fields | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Using Encrypted Merge Fields with Salesforce Using Other Encryption Methods Help Survey Builder Encrypting Merge Fields GetFeedback Encrypting Merge Fields Using Encrypted Merge Fields with Salesforce Using Other Encryption Methods By default, respondents can view the merge field data in the survey link. For example, if you use the Contact ID merge field, your respondents can see their Contact ID in the link when they take your survey. Respondents may also be able to manipulate or remove merge fields from your survey link. You can encrypt merge fields to hide personal data from your survey respondents and prevent them from changing the link. Using Encrypted Merge Fields with Salesforce Encrypt your Salesforce merge fields . Setting Up Salesforce GetFeedback Support can’t consult on coding issues. Reach out to your Salesforce administrator for help implementing these features. These examples help you get started with our Salesforce integration and you may need to make changes for your organization. Create a custom field for encrypted data and an apex trigger to fill the field with merge fields you’d like to include. Create a custom field called GF Encrypted Data . Create a new trigger, using the code sample below as an example. It’s best to work with your Salesforce administrator before using this code. Blob key = EncodingUtil.convertFromHex(<encryptionKey>); Blob encrypted = Crypto.encryptWithManagedIV('AES128', key, Blob.valueOf( 'ContactId=&CaseId=&FirstName=' )); String cipherText = EncodingUtil.convertToHex(encrypted); // Store this value in your custom field GF_Encrypted_Data__c Make sure to replace the encryption key and merge fields we have in angle brackets with the merge fields that you’d like to collect, using the correct syntax for each. Admins can generate or delete GetFeedback encryption keys in their account settings under Encryption keys . You can create two tokens at a time. Turning On Encryption for Your Survey Make sure the encryption key has been added to the trigger code before turning on encryption. If you turn on encryption without adding the key to your trigger code, your survey may break. To turn on encryption for your survey: Create or open a survey. From the survey builder, select Settings . Make sure you’re in the Draft survey. Under Merge Field Encryption , turn on the toggle to Use encrypted merge fields in survey links . Select Publish draft . (optional) Copying Your Survey Link If you’re creating a template to send from Salesforce, copy the survey link to add to your Salesforce email template. If you’re sending your survey using our Salesforce automation, you don’t need to copy the survey link. To copy your survey link: From the survey builder, select Distribute > Survey Link . Select Copy . You can use this link in the email you create in Salesforce. Creating Your Salesforce Email Template and Adding Merge Fields Create the email that will go out from Salesforce. If you’re using our Salesforce email automation , we create the Salesforce flow and outbound message for you. Once you paste your survey link into the email, you can add your encrypted merge fields. You can put a merge field in an email template, custom URL, or formula to incorporate values from a record. A merge field stores information so the link can pull customer information when someone takes your survey. To add encrypted merge fields, use the code below, replacing the link with your own survey link. https://www.getfeedback.com/r/xxxxxxxx?gf_data={!GF_Encrypted_Data__c} Note that {!GF_Encrypted_Data__c} is the custom field that we just created back in step one. Sending Your Email Once your email is sent, your custom field will then pull in all of your merge fields based on the apex trigger you created. Test your email a few times using real contacts in Salesforce before sending to your larger list. Make sure to send respondents the encrypted version of your survey link. Otherwise, the survey won’t display. Using Other Encryption Methods If you're using a distribution tool other than Salesforce, you may need to write custom code. Please use the encryption libraries available for your platform. You’ll need to: Encrypt the query string parameters using AES128 encryption Encode the ciphertext as a hexadecimal string Use the hexadecimal string as the gf_data querystring parameter of the survey link.

There are three types of skip logic: Skip Logic Type Description Question Skip Logic Applied to a question. Lets you skip respondents to a future question or page in the survey based on the answer choice they select. Page Skip Logic Applied to a page. Lets you skip everyone that reaches the page to a specific destination later in the survey—like a later page or the end of the survey. Unlike Question Skip Logic, Page Skip Logic doesn't depend on respondents' answers to specific questions—it's simply activated when a respondent reaches that page, and clicks Next. Advanced Branching Applied to a page. Lets you skip respondents to future points in your survey, show or hide questions, show or hide pages, or invalidate questions based on multiple conditions. You can build conditions based on a respondent's answers, custom data from Contacts , and custom variables . If you have Advanced Branching in your account, it replaces Page Skip Logic, so you can also use this feature to skip respondents to a designated page no matter what answer they select. Expand | Collapse Example Let's say you want to send a survey to two different groups: Group A lives in one city and Group B lives in another. In this case, we want to create 5 pages. Set them up in the following way: Page 1 : Include an introduction to explain the goal of the survey. Page 2 : Add a Multiple Choice question asking respondents to select the group they belong to: Group A or Group B. Then apply Question Skip Logic to each answer choice: send Group A to Page 3 and Group B to Page 4. Page 3 : Add questions you want to ask only to Group A. Then apply Page Skip Logic to send respondents to Page 5 when they click the Next button. Page 4 : Add questions you want to ask only to Group B. Then apply Page Skip Logic to send respondents to Page 5 when they click the Next button. Page 5 : Ask any questions you want to ask both groups. Then set up a Survey End Page for your collector—this is the page respondents will see when they click Done on Page 5. Troubleshooting Read more about troubleshooting Skip Logic issues .

How to Find the Smallest Value (MIN),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/smallest-value/,"How to Find the Smallest Value (MIN) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the MIN Function? Proper Formatting for MIN Expressions Limitations of the MIN Function Help Advanced Features How to Find the Smallest Value (MIN) Apply How to Find the Smallest Value (MIN) What is the MIN Function? Proper Formatting for MIN Expressions Limitations of the MIN Function Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. Using the MIN function you can return the smallest value out of a list of values given by your applicants. What is the MIN Function? The MIN function accepts a list of floating or integer values and returns the smallest one. This can either be used for a single row or column within a grid question, the table as a whole or a list of variables within the form. Proper Formatting for MIN Expressions Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of MIN and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive Always close each MIN operation with brackets ( ) Can contain a (,) to separate values. Cannot contain any operators such (+),(-),(*), etc. MIN of Select Cells {{ MIN(q1[0],q1[2],[q1[3]) }} Based on Grid Indexing , this will give you the smallest value of the 1st, 3rd, and 4th cells. MIN of a Column {{ MIN(q1[:0]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will find the smallest value in column 1. MIN of a Row {{ MIN(q2[1:]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will find the smallest value in Row 2. MIN of a Range {{ MIN(q1[0:4]) }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will give you the smallest value of the first 4 cells. MIN of Reviewer Scores {{ MIN(q1.score,q2.score,q3.score) }} The value of the lowest score given to one of the listed questions. Limitations of the MIN Function The MIN function would not be able to perform any operations using an expression such as addition (+) nor would it be possible to have other functions within a single MIN expression such as SUM to calculate the different variables together to then find the smallest value. The best way to pull the smallest value from this information would be to have to have the SUM operations on one page and pipe the the totals to the next page using the MIN expression.

These translations are applied using a template that can be downloaded directly from your site. This article serves as a guide for adding additional languages to your site to provide a smooth and easy to use experience for your users. NOTE: We do not support all languages at this time. To see a list of available languages, please navigate to the Translations page on your site. Overview The Translations page serves as the management hub where administrators can add, monitor, and toggle the availability of languages within a site. Once a language has been added and made visible, users will be able to toggle between the available languages at their choosing. For a language to be available the requested translations must be uploaded to the site using a .csv file format. The process requires downloading a translation template and uploading the populated file into the site. The availability of languages can be limited until all translations have been added and verified. Accessing the Translations Page To navigate to the Translations page: Select Settings Select Translations Translation Features Below is a description of the various sections and labels visible within the Translations page.

Select the file to open using excel where you can begin inputting your translations TIP! The option to show all translatable text template should be used for an initial translation attempt. This will download a file containing all available text to translate for the new language. Adding Translations to Your Template How to Complete a Translation Template Once you have downloaded the template and opened the file within Excel, you will see that there is a dedicated language column for the translations you are adding. The order of the columns within the file are displayed in the image below. Your translations must be added to Column B in order for the upload to add the translation. To translate a field: From the template, locate the field you are looking to translate Add the translation to Column B. The translation for the English text must be added to the same row. NOTE: Any translations that are omitted will be skipped when the template is uploaded and will appear in English when the new language is used. Blank fields will not appear blank when the language is toggled. Template Tips Do not convert the file to an .xls file. A .csv file is required to upload your translations later. The ID column can help determine which program or task the English text is affiliated with. Compare the ID with the ID that appears in the program/task URL. If the ID is not found in the program/task URL then the field is associated with another program/task. Do not add new fields to the template. If the field is not located in the template then the field cannot be translated. Do not remove fields from the template. Skip any fields that you do not wish to translate. These fields will appear in English when the new language is used. Adjust the columns size of the template to avoid skipping a field and to see your entire translated text Adjust the columns size of the template to avoid skipping a field and to see your entire translated text The template will only support ONE language per file. Do not add additional columns for other languages. Extra languages will need their own translation file. The template will only support ONE language per file.

Using CSS Keywords to Adjust Layout,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/themes/layout-css/,"Using CSS Keywords to Adjust Layout | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo In this article Adding CSS Layout Keywords to a Field Keywords for Placing Fields Side by Side Keywords for Hiding Fields Keywords for Changing Text Layout Create Your Own CSS Keywords Help Themes and Styles Layouts Using CSS Keywords to Adjust Layout Wufoo Using CSS Keywords to Adjust Layout Adding CSS Layout Keywords to a Field Keywords for Placing Fields Side by Side Keywords for Hiding Fields Keywords for Changing Text Layout Create Your Own CSS Keywords CSS Layout Keywords, which you can enter in the Field Settings of any field on your form, let you adjust the layout and position of fields and text on your form, or hide certain form elements. They're super easy to use and give you more control over the look and feel of your form. You don't need to know CSS to take advantage of this feature, but if you're familiar with CSS, here's how these work: CSS Layout Keywords are classnames—adding one of our CSS Layout Keywords to a field adds that classname to the parent element surrounding that field. This applies the styles associated with that class, as defined in the CSS stylesheet that governs all Wufoo forms, to your field. Adding CSS Layout Keywords to a Field To add a CSS Layout Keyword to a field: Log in and go to Forms . Click the form you want to edit. Click the field whose layout you want to adjust. This opens the Field Settings. In the Add CSS Layout Keywords field, enter one or more CSS Keywords. If you're adding multiple keywords, separate each one with a space. Click Save Form . You won't see the updated layout in the Form Builder—you'll have to view your form to see the magic at work! The CSS Keywords will also be reflected in the Entry Manager. Keywords for Placing Fields Side by Side You can also use CSS Keywords to place 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive fields side by side, instead of the default layout where each field starts on its own line. CSS Layout Keywords Description Compatible Field Types leftHalf rightHalf Use these keywords on two consecutive fields to place them side by side, two in a row. All, except Likert leftThird middleThird rightThird Use these keywords on three consecutive fields to place them side by side, three in a row. All, except Likert leftFourth middleFourth middleFourth rightFourth Use these keywords on four consecutive fields (use middleFourth on both the second and third field) to place them side by side, four in a row. All, except Likert leftFifth middleFifth middleFifth middleFifth rightFifth Use these keywords on five consecutive fields (use middleFifth on the second, third, and fourth fields) to place them side by side, five in a row. All, except Likert View Examples 2 fields side by side 3 fields side by side 4 fields side by side 5 fields side by side Keywords for Hiding Fields The following keywords are for hiding fields, or specific parts of a field. CSS Layout Keyword Description Compatible Field Types hide Hides the entire field from your public-facing form. The field will still be visible to administrators in the Entry Manager, so you can still populate values into the field using URL Modifications, which makes it useful for tracking. All cloak Hides all the inputs in a field, but leaves the field label. The field will still be visible to administrators in the Entry Manager. Learn how to use this keyword to create a coupon system. All hideSecondary Hides the Previous link that lets people go back to previous pages in your form. Page Break hideCents Hides the Cents textbox in the Price field. Price hideSeconds Hides the Seconds textbox in the Time field. Time hideAMPM Hides the AM/PM dropdown menu in the Time field. Time hideAddr2 Hides the second street address textbox in the Address field. Address Using the hide keyword on an unanswered required field will trigger an error when someone tries to submit the form. Make sure that all hidden fields are optional. Keywords for Changing Text Layout The following keywords are for changing the way additional text in your form is displayed. CSS Layout Keyword Description Compatible Field Types altInstruct Moves the Instructions for User under the field, instead of in a box to the right of the field. This keyword can't be used with the full width Newfangled theme. All scrollText Converts a Section Break field into a fixed-height box with a scrollbar. This comes in handy if you have a long chunk of text that takes up too much room on your form. Section Break View Examples altInstruct scrollText Create Your Own CSS Keywords If you know CSS, you can take this one step further by creating your own CSS Keywords. Since keywords are just CSS classnames added to the parent element surrounding a field, you can easily attach your own stylesheet to a theme that contains your own rules based on that classname being added to the field, and then reference those classes in the field settings on your form: Add a Custom CSS stylesheet to your theme, and apply that theme to your form. Go back to the Form Builder to edit your form. Enter your custom class name in the Add CSS Layout Keywords field setting on the field of your choice! This will add the class to the parent element of the field.

How to add an Identifier to a Question,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/identifier-question/,"How to add an Identifier to a Question | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to add an Identifier How does the Identifier Appear within the Site Reasons you may require an Identifier Help Build Forms How to add an Identifier to a Question Apply How to add an Identifier to a Question How to add an Identifier How does the Identifier Appear within the Site Reasons you may require an Identifier Identifiers are used as an internal way of referring to a question in the site. They are most commonly added to questions when you require the use of Advanced Expression Piping (AEP) within your form. They are short, one word, values made up of letters and numbers. How to add an Identifier In order to add an Identifier to a question: Access the Form Builder of the form you are looking to edit. Click on the Question you wish to add the identifier to. On the left of the screen under the question type dropdown is the Identifier . If you have no value currently as an identifier the value will say None. Click on the word None, or if there is a value there click on the current value to be given a text box. Enter the Identifier you wish to give to the question. Save the form. Once the Identifier has been added you will notice it will appear as small, text above the question. Question identifiers are case sensitive, must begin with a letter, and may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. TIP! To ensure that you can easily identify the question later, make sure the identifier is related to the question. For example, if you have a question that asks for the ""Home Address"" of your applicant, an identifier you may use would be home_address or home address . For longer questions, it is still important to keep the identifier short, therefore for questions such as ""Name your top 3 favorite colors"" your identifier may be favorite colors or three colors. How does the Identifier Appear within the Site When the identifier is added to the question this is how it will be identified internally throughout the site, it will replace the original question which is why it is important that it is related to the question so you can easily identify it later. It will be displayed in the following sections: In the Piping Wizard of an Applicant form or a Reviewer form Within all Filters The identifier will not be displayed to any of your end-users when they are filling out their forms. Reasons you may require an Identifier Below is a list of reasons for adding an identifier to a question: Add an AEP formula to your form Use the Piping Wizard within an Applicant Form Use the Piping Wizard within a Reviewer Form Easily identify long questions Easily identify questions that appear more than once in your site Easily identify questions that don't have a title Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Having scoring within your form allows you to add automations to your system and to filter applications. This is commonly used for when a reviewer completes their review of an application, you can set an automation to move their application to the next stage based on the score. Example: If applications are scored out of 20, you can set up automations so that: any application that receives a total score of less than 10 be moved to an Ineligible Holding Stage . any application that receives a score of 10-20 be moved to a second review stage.

You will still be able to activate, edit, and deactivate existing workflows after this change. However, you’ll need to build new automations using Flow Builder. Flows give you more flexibility to add conditions to your automation. Here’s what that means for your GetFeedback automations and Programs in Salesforce. GetFeedback Automations and Flows If you manually create automations, you can use Flows to automate your surveys. Flows allow you to create and update records, send outbound messages or email templates, and more. Our Salesforce Automation and Salesforce Programs automatically create workflow rules, not Flows. We’re planning to update our automations to create Flows instead of workflow rules. For now, you can manually attach your survey to a Flow in Salesforce, then deactivate your workflow rule. Migrating to Flows in Salesforce If you use our Salesforce Automation or a Salesforce Program , we’ve created a workflow rule and outbound message for you. Salesforce recommends you start migrating your workflow rules to Flows. You can either use the Migrate to Flow tool provided by Salesforce or manually create Flows and attach your outbound messages to them. If you move your outbound message to a Flow, you can’t pause or deactivate your Program from GetFeedback. To migrate an existing survey workflow (such as a Case Closed workflow) to a Flow: Create a Flow in Salesforce. Choose the flow type that works best for your use case. Attach your outbound message to the Flow. Deactivate the workflow rule that was previously using your outbound message.

Advanced Mapping with Relationships,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/salesforce-relationship-mapping/,"Advanced Mapping with Relationships | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Reference an Existing Action from Another Action (Lookup Fields) How to Link Two or More Salesforce Objects (Junction Objects) Help Advanced Features Advanced Mapping with Relationships Apply Advanced Mapping with Relationships How to Reference an Existing Action from Another Action (Lookup Fields) How to Link Two or More Salesforce Objects (Junction Objects) How to Reference an Existing Action from Another Action (Lookup Fields) SurveyMonkey Apply offers a way to reference an existing action from another action. This occurs in the field mapping of a push or pull action. To reference an existing action: Go to the Salesforce Integration section Click on the Title of the Integration you wish to add to. Click the Add Action button. This will open a dialogue where you’ll configure the action. Choose Push to Salesforce (this is unavailable for Pull actions). Begin setting up the action as you normally would. In the Apply field dropdown. Select the action that you want to map. Complete setting up the action as you normally would. The mapping of lookup fields follows a SurveyMonkey Apply object sync with the Salesforce object. Because of this, any lookup fields you plan on syncing to should be optional in Salesforce. If not, the initial sync will fail because we can't provide the lookup field in the original sync. For more information on Lookup and Master-Detail relationships see: Relationships Among Objects You cannot reference a Master-Detail field or required Lookup field when using the “Salesforce object from existing action” SM Apply field in the field mapping section. Example: Let’s say you have an application with a form asking for contact information from an applicant and their former boss. In Salesforce, you want to keep track of the applicant as a “Client” record, and the former boss as a custom “boss” record. You also want the boss record to have a field that points to the applicant, ensuring that there is a link between the two. In this configuration you would need two actions. Action 1 (Applicant) Field Mappings Apply Field Salesforce Field Application owner email Client email Action 2 (Boss) Field Mappings Apply Field Salesforce Field Form question [what was your former boss’ email?] Boss email Relationships Apply Action Salesforce Field Action 1 Applicant In this example, when the applicant completes their application, a client record will be created with the applicant’s email, and a boss record will be completed with the boss’ email (The applicant entered that information when filling out the application form). The boss record will ALSO have a link to the client that was created for the applicant. In this way, when going through your boss records in Salesforce you will be able to see which applicant belongs to which boss. How to Link Two or More Salesforce Objects (Junction Objects) A junction object in Salesforce is an object that links two or more Salesforce objects. It will have a Lookup OR Master-Detail Relationship with references to the two related objects. We have the ability in SM Apply Salesforce to map Junction objects using lookup fields. For more information on junction objects see: Creating a Many to Many Relationship You cannot reference a Master-Detail field or required Lookup field when using the “Salesforce object from existing action” SM Apply field in the field mapping section. Example: Like the Lookup Field example, let’s say you want to keep track of an applicant’s former bosses, but instead of one boss, you want 3 bosses. You could use the same technique as above and add the applicant to each boss record. However, there is another way you can link these items together. Instead of having the boss reference the applicant, you can use a custom object to reference the applicant AND all of the bosses. The configuration would look something like this: Action 1 (Applicant) Field Mappings Apply Field Salesforce Field Application owner email Client email Action 2 (Boss 1) Field Mappings Apply Field Salesforce Field Form question [what was your former boss’ email?] Boss email Action 3 (Boss 2) Field Mappings Apply Field Salesforce Field Form question [what was your former boss’ email?] Boss email Action 5 (ApplicantBossJunction) Relationships Apply Action Salesforce Field Action 1 Applicant Action 2 Boss 1 Action 3 Boss 2 Action 4 Boss 3 Now, when the application syncs to Salesforce, a new ""ApplicantBossJunction"" is created, and that record will reference each of the newly created bosses as well as the newly created client. NOTE: ""ApplicantBossJunction"" is custom Object name used for this example.

Log in Sign up free Question Skip Logic lets you skip respondents to a later page, or a specific question on a later page, based on their answer to a previous closed-ended question. Video Overview Question Types You can apply Question Skip Logic to the following closed-ended question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown NPS Star Rating Matrix/Rating Scale (Single-row rating scale only) Image Choice You can apply Question Skip Logic to Checkboxes questions with multiple answers allowed, but use caution. If a respondent chooses multiple answers, each with different logic paths, the survey can only skip them according to the logic path of the first answer choice in the list. Adding Logic To add Question Skip Logic: Click the Design Survey tab. Click the question to which you want to add skip logic. Click the Logic tab. For each answer option, choose the page you want to send respondents to from the Then skip to... column. You don't have to apply logic to all answer choices. (Page options described below.) Choose to send respondents to the top of the page or to a particular question on the page. If you're sending respondents to a particular question, the previous questions on that page will be hidden from them. Click Save . Test your logic! Preview the survey to test all possible logic paths before sending it out. Responses aren't recorded when previewing. Page Options Skip to Description Any page number This will skip respondents to the designated page. You must move respondents forward through the survey, and not backward. End of Survey This will send respondents directly to the end of the survey, which will activate the Survey End Page you specified in the collector options. Their response will be considered COMPLETE when you view their individual response in the Analyze Results section. Disqualify Respondent This will send respondents to a disqualification page. You can customize the disqualification page in the Collector Options. Their response will be considered DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response in the Analyze Results section. Details Skip logic is triggered when people click the Next button on a survey page. A page break is necessary between the triggering question and the question people are skipped to. Question Skip Logic overrides Page Skip Logic if both are applied on the same page. If you have Advanced Branching instead, see Using Advanced Branching with Question Skip Logic to learn how these rules work together. It's important to only move respondents forward in a survey—if you send respondents backwards, it could create an endless loop and prevent them from completing the survey. When Skip Logic is applied, we automatically renumber question and page numbers, if you have numbering turned on . You should only apply logic to one question on a page since the survey can't skip respondents to two places—it will skip respondents according to the logic path of the first question on the page. We suggest placing questions with Skip Logic applied at the end of a page. This helps you remember which questions have logic applied, and keeps the experience relevant for the respondent. Create a Filter by Question and Answer to see your Skip Logic paths when analyzing results.

Quizzes,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/quizzes/,"Quizzes | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Creating a Quiz Assigning Points Showing People Their Score Analyzing Quiz Results Exports and Shared Data Help Creating Surveys Survey Use Cases & Templates Quizzes SurveyMonkey Quizzes Creating a Quiz Assigning Points Showing People Their Score Analyzing Quiz Results Exports and Shared Data Turn any survey into a quiz by adding quiz questions! When people answer a quiz question, you can tell them whether they got the answer right, or keep their scores to yourself. When you analyze your results, you'll get overall score statistics, and individual scores for each person that took the quiz. Creating a Quiz Add a Quiz Question You can make any survey into a quiz by adding at least one quiz question to your survey. TIP! When you create a new survey from scratch and choose the Quiz category, any new Multiple Choice, Checkbox, Image Choice, or Dropdown questions you add will have scoring turned on by default. To add a quiz question: Create a Multiple Choice , Checkbox , Image Choice , or Dropdown question and add the question text and answer choices you need. All other question types aren’t compatible with Quizzes. Select Score this question (enable quiz mode) —this makes it into a quiz question with scoring. Define which answers are correct by clicking the empty checkmark icon to the left of an answer choice. The checkmark icon fills in to indicate that it's the correct answer. You can choose more than one correct answer. Adjust the point value of any correct answer choice by clicking the up and down arrows next to the point value. Click Save . If your survey has quiz questions, avoid using logic, as it's not compatible with Display Quiz Results . Quiz scores are calculated using the total points in the survey. With skip logic, some people might skip over some questions in the survey which can result in their scores being lower because they didn’t answer all quiz questions. Scoring Checkbox Questions If your Checkbox or Image Choice quiz question uses checkboxes to allow more than one answer, you should require people to select a specific number of answer choices . Otherwise, since points aren't deducted for incorrect answers, even if someone selects a wrong answer in addition to the correct ones, they'd still get the full points for the question—which might lead to a confusing final score. For example, if there are two correct answers to the question, you should require that respondents select exactly 2 choices. TIP! In the question text, make sure to tell people how many answer choices they should select. Add Custom Feedback to a Quiz Question Quizzes Pro Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free You can display different feedback to people based on whether their answer is correct, incorrect, or partially correct on the Quiz Results Page . For example, if someone gets a question right, you can tell them “Good job, friend.” If they get it wrong, you can say ""Better luck next time"" or tell them the right answer. To add custom feedback to a quiz question: Click a quiz question to edit it. Click the Options tab. Click Add Custom Feedback to Question . Enter feedback for each outcome. Assigning Points You can assign points to answer choices when quiz mode is enabled for a question. The typical point value for a correct answer is 1, but you can assign more than 1 point to any answer choice. It’s not possible to assign negative points to an answer choice. The points people earn for each question are added up into a total score when they finish the quiz. It's not possible to view or group scores by page or section. TIP! It's possible to adjust points assigned to quiz questions even after responses are collected. Any changes to point values will be reflected in the existing scores on the Analyze page . Max Score When you're editing a quiz question, you can see the maximum number of points someone can earn for that question. For Dropdown or Multiple Choice questions (where only one answer is allowed), the max score is equal to the highest point value assigned to an answer choice in the question. For Multiple Choice questions using checkboxes (where respondents can choose more than one answer), the max score is equal to total point value across all answer choices (regardless of whether you require a limit or range of answer choices). When someone gets the max score for a question, the question is considered correct in the question summary and in their individual response in the results. Partial Credit You can set up your quiz so that people can get partial credit for choosing certain answers. For example, you can assign 2 points to the best answer, and 1 point to the answer choice you want to give partial credit for. If the respondent gets partial credit (not the max score possible for the question), their individual response will show that they got the question ""partially correct"". Showing People Their Score Show Quiz Results at the End of the Quiz You can choose whether you want to show someone their total quiz score, and a summary of how they did on each individual quiz question, when they finish the quiz. The quiz results page only includes quiz questions—questions without scoring aren't included. Unlike Instant Results , the quiz results page only shows the respondent's own score. No one can see other people's scores. To display quiz results to respondents at the end of a quiz: In the left sidebar, click Options . Make sure quiz mode is enabled. Select Display Quiz Results . (Optional) If you don't want respondents to see the correct answers to the questions they got wrong, deselect Show correct answers to incorrect responses . Limitations Display Quiz Results is not available when using Kiosk Mode . The following logic options are not compatible with Display Quiz Results: Question Skip Logic Page Skip Logic Advanced Branching Carry Forward Responses Block Randomization Question & Answer Piping Advanced Piping If you add incompatible logic to a survey when Display Quiz Results is turned on, the Quiz Results Page will be automatically disabled. Show Custom Feedback on the Quiz Results Page Quizzes Pro Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free When the Display Quiz Results setting is turned on, you can show custom feedback at the end of a quiz (an image, text, or both). It'll display at the top of the quiz results page, right above the score. You can either add a general message that everyone sees no matter what score they get, or you can show different feedback for different score ranges. For example, you can tell people that score 95% to 99% ""Almost perfect! You should be proud."" Custom feedback can be up to 1,000 characters.

Click +New Range and repeat the steps to add more custom messages for different score ranges. TIP!

Use Send to a List to send a survey directly from GetFeedback instead of an external email provider. Manually create your mailing list and design your email template. When respondents select the Call to Action, the rest of the survey opens in their web browser. You can also personalize your email invitations and track responses with merge fields. There's a limit of up to 10,000 emails a day and up to 100,000 emails per month. Sending a Survey to a List (Video) Sending Your Survey to a list in GetFeedback From the survey builder, select Distribute > Email > List to start building your email and list. Build your automation in the Live version of your survey. When you publish your survey, any Draft settings will be erased and can't be recovered.

If you use a later question, the survey still opens in the browser on the first question. Choose your Email Call to Action . You can either set up a button to begin your survey or embed a survey question in your email. The colors in the email will match your survey theme. Add a button to begin survey : Select Button to Begin Survey to add a customizable button in your survey email. When recipients select the button, the survey opens in their web browser. Embed a question : Select a question to include in the body of your email. When the respondent answers the question, the rest of the survey (or a completion page for single-page surveys) opens in their web browser. We recommend removing the title page from your survey to make it flow more smoothly. You can only embed certain question types within an email, and you'll see which types are available within the Email Call To Action list. Managing Email Details Update your email details, including the email subject, sender name, and sender address. Subject Enter the subject line for your email. Once you add your email list, you can personalize the subject line using merge fields. From Name Enter the sender name to show on the email.

This should be anything that’s easily recognizable to your customers, such as the name of your company or “support.” Learn more about complying with spam policies Your email domain . You can select one of our default domains or your own custom domain. If you use the default address, the reply-to address will be your GetFeedback login email, and people may be able to see and reply to your personal address. If you use a custom email domain, you can use the Sender email as the reply-to address. Select your custom domain, then check the box to set your custom email address as the reply-to address. Learn how to request a custom domain Don't use accented characters (such as é or á) in the account name. Special characters will cause the email to fail. Don’t add the email domain to the account name (such as @getfeedback.com). You’ll select the domain after entering a name. If you add the domain to the name, your email will fail. Adding and Email Footer Include additional language, like legal disclosures, in your email footer as hyperlinks. To add a footer to your email, select Add an optional footer message and links at the bottom of the email template. Creating your List There's a limit of 2,000 recipients per email and 10,000 emails per day. Create your mailing list and add any merge fields you want to track. We can't save your email list for later or import CSV email lists. You'll need to enter or paste the list in GetFeedback each time your send an email. If you have a Salesforce integration, you can send your survey emails to a list built with a Salesforce report instead. To add your recipients: Select the Create List field on the left side of your screen. Type each recipient's email address on a new line. To add any merge fields for information you want to track, such as name or company, place a comma after the person's email address, then enter the information. To add another field, place another comma and add the next field. For example, to track both a respondent's name and company, enter the information in this format: emailaddress@company.com, Name, Company name If you don't have information for a recipient, leave a blank between the commas where the information would go. Each person in the list must have the same number of commas. When you've added all your email recipients and merge fields, select Save . After saving your list, match the information in your list to their merge field names. You can also create custom merge fields for other information, such as account name or age. To match your list items to their merge field names: For each field, select the matching field name from the dropdown list. you can choose from the standard merge field names: Email Name Company (Optional) To create a custom merge field, such as Membership level, select Custom and enter a field name. When you name your merge fields, don't use any special characters like ', $, #, @, or *. Select Next to finish adding your recipients and merge fields to your email. Personalize your Email with Merge Fields If you added information about your recipients, which we call merge fields, you can now personalize your email's subject, body, and button using this info. To personalize your email with merge fields: Select the subject line, header, body, or button in your email, then select the Personalize button. If you haven't added merge fields in your email list yet, the Personalize button won't appear. Select from any of the merge fields you already mapped when creating the list. (Optional) If you have someone on your list with missing information, like first or last name, enter a fallback term to use as a placeholder. When you send the email, we'll substitute fallback terms for empty merge fields. Example : For a missing first name, you could use ""valued customer"" as the fallback term. Fallback terms only work in the email subject and body. If you have personalization in the survey body and those fields are blank, they will remain blank. Select Next . Track Responses with Merge Fields Merge fields are helpful to track survey responses in another application like Salesforce. If you add merge fields to your email list, we add the information to the survey URL for each respondent. When the respondent takes your survey, we pull the merge field information into the survey response table to help you track responses. Scheduling an End Date If you need to end your survey at a certain time, select Schedule an end date on the footer of the email builder. Pick a date from the calendar popup. Your survey ends on the date you select. After the end date, no additional survey responses will be collected. Allowing Anonymous Surveys To keep responses anonymous, turn off the slider next to Enable email tracking in the footer of the email builder. When someone completes your survey, their results display without their email address. Sending your Email When you're ready, click the Send Preview or Send button on the footer of the email builder to send the survey email. If you select Send Preview , we send a preview email to the email address on file for your GetFeedback account. After you send your email, you can either Send another email or View survey responses . Viewing Survey Results You can view real-time responses, a summary report, or the email distribution results. To view detailed survey responses in real time, go to your survey and select Results > Responses . To view a summary report, go to Results > Summary . To view survey distribution results, such as email open rate and bounce rate, go to Results > Distribution . Frequently Asked Questions Will my email send right away? It may take a few minutes for your email to send, but it will send within minutes of pressing the Send button. Do you have any specific rules as to who I can send to? Yes, we do have spam rules in place. You can see those in your account agreement . How can I see who opened or clicked a link in my email? GetFeedback will track this information for you by default so you can see the total number of surveys that have been clicked and opened. You can see the information by navigating to View Results and reviewing your Summary Report within your survey. If you don't want to track this information, you can collect results anonymously instead. What happens if someone forwards my survey? If a survey link is forwarded on to someone else outside of your recipient list, that person will also be able to take your survey. However, if you're using merge fields in your email, the response will be recorded as the original person you sent the email to. This is because that unique information about your recipients is stored in your survey link. When that email is forwarded on, that unique link stays the same and will continue to be tracked just as if it was the original recipient. To prevent this, consider encrypting your merge fields .

NPS Key Driver Analysis,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/insights/nps-key-driver-analysis/,"NPS Key Driver Analysis | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Best Practices for Key Driver Questions Using the Key Driver Question (Optional) Map Responses to Salesforce and Zendesk Key Driver Dashboard Tile Understanding Your Key Driver Score Help Insights Results and reports NPS Key Driver Analysis GetFeedback NPS Key Driver Analysis Best Practices for Key Driver Questions Using the Key Driver Question (Optional) Map Responses to Salesforce and Zendesk Key Driver Dashboard Tile Understanding Your Key Driver Score Pro feature : Available on Pro and Ultimate plans. In app.getfeedback.com , the Key Driver Analysis is a Net Promoter® Score (NPS) follow-up question and dashboard tile. The Key Driver question is a structured follow-up question that asks, “ How would you rate us in these areas? ” You can customize the question to include key areas of your business so you can measure their impact on your customer experience. The Key Driver dashboard tile displays results from your key driver question to help you identify the business areas impacting your score. The tile results can help you proactively make changes to improve customer loyalty. The NPS Key Driver tile isn't available in Workspaces. Best Practices for Key Driver Questions Set up your question with the low score on the left side of the survey builder and the high score on the right side (for example, 0-10 or Poor - Excellent). Switching the direction of the response may cause negative correlation and add a warning to the dashboard tile. Phrase your key drivers positively. For example, use ""Breadth of inventory"" instead of ""Inventory shortfalls."" Key Driver questions that use shapes (hearts, stars, or circles) must have at least 5 shapes to make sure you get a range of responses to track trends. We recommend collecting at least 30+ responses to help you get better data trends. Using the Key Driver Question You can create a new NPS survey with a Key Driver question or add it to an existing survey. Creating a New NPS Survey In the survey builder, select +Add Question , then select Key Driver . Enter a Potential Driver you want your customers to rate, such as Customer Support or Delivery Speed. To add more drivers, select add below the Potential Driver field. Adding Key Driver to an Existing NPS Survey When you change a question type, any previous responses to that question are deleted. Consider making a backup of your survey before you change an existing NPS follow-up question (likely multiple choice) to the Key Driver question. If you’re already using an NPS survey, you can add the Key Driver question to your survey. However, you should keep any existing questions to avoid deleting previous responses. There are two ways to add a Key Driver question without deleting existing questions: Add a Key Driver question to your existing survey and use survey branching logic to skip over the original follow-up question and preserve previously collected responses. When viewing feedback, you can compare key driver results to previous responses. Copy your existing NPS survey and change the original follow-up question (likely multiple choice) to the Key Driver question type. To view feedback, compare your old and new NPS surveys side by side in your GetFeedback dashboard or Salesforce reporting. (Optional) Map Responses to Salesforce and Zendesk Map your Key Driver responses to a custom Key Driver field in Salesforce or Zendesk. In Salesforce , you can map Key Driver responses to Number , Text , or Text Area fields. Make sure to map each Key Driver item to its own field in Salesforce. Learn more about compatible Salesforce fields In Zendesk , you can map Key Driver responses to Number , Decimal , Drop-down , or Text fields. Learn more about compatible Zendesk fields Learn how to set up Salesforce custom mappings or Zendesk custom mappings Key Driver Dashboard Tile In your app.getfeedback.com dashboard, measure the correlation between your NPS score and key drivers to understand which areas of your business are impacting your customer loyalty. The key driver dashboard tile highlights the areas affecting your business so you can improve customer experience. Adding the Tile In your dashboard, select New Tile . Then, select your survey and the Key Driver question. Reading the tile Here’s an explanation of the tile results. Potential driver : The business areas you included in the Key Driver question. Potential drivers are areas of your business that mayyou affect your customers’ brand perception and loyalty.. Correlation with NPS : How much the potential driver’s scores vary with NPS scores. When you observe a high driver score, you also observe a high NPS score; a low NPS score matches a low driver score. For example, if you have a low NPS score with low correlation to your potential driver, that driver may not be affecting your NPS score. Average driver score : The average score respondents gave to a driver, which shows overall customer satisfaction with a potential driver. Driver score distribution : The spread of your response scores. Understanding Your Key Driver Score We use Spearman's rank correlation on the NPS score and Key Driver question to calculate your correlation score. Hover over your dashboard tile to highlight the statistical significance of the data (also called the P Score). The statistical significance helps us understand how likely it is that the score is accurate. Strong correlation and high average driver score: Key value driver Strong correlation and low average driver score: Key pain point Weak correlation and a high average driver score: Possible area to remove investment Weak correlation and a low average driver score: No action recommended Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

How to Pay by Invoice,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/invoice-billing/,"How to Pay by Invoice | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article How Invoicing Works Choosing Invoice During Checkout Switching Your Account to Invoicing Help Payments & Billing Invoices & Receipts How to Pay by Invoice SurveyMonkey How to Pay by Invoice How Invoicing Works Choosing Invoice During Checkout Switching Your Account to Invoicing How Invoicing Works If you'd like to be emailed an invoice to pay manually rather than be auto-charged for your subscription, you can pay by invoice. Invoicing is available for annual plans only. Here's how it works: We’ll email you and your billing contact an invoice after you sign up. When it's time to renew , we'll email you the next invoice to pay 45 days before your renewal. The payment methods you can use and any special instructions will be right there on the invoice. If you’re paying the invoice by credit or debit card, make sure not to check the box to ""make this the default payment method"" or it’ll switch you to auto-pay! You need to keep auto-renew turned on to be emailed an invoice. This doesn’t mean we auto-charge you! It just means we can automatically create an invoice to email you. If you turn auto-renew off, we won’t create you an invoice and your account will downgrade at your renewal date. Just make your payment by the renewal date and you’ll be all set! If your payment arrives a little late, don’t worry—you won’t lose access to your account, surveys, or data right away (we have a short grace period). But you might not be able to download results until your payment arrives. After some time has passed and we don't get your payment, your account will downgrade to a free plan, but you can upgrade again whenever. Choosing Invoice During Checkout When you sign up for a paid plan, the payment methods you can choose from are all right there on the SurveyMonkey checkout page after you choose your billing country. Select Invoice on the checkout page, confirm your subscription, then go to your Transaction History and click Pay Invoice. You can use paid features as soon as your payment is processed . Switching Your Account to Invoicing If you've already got a paid account and you want to switch from having your card auto-charged to being emailed an invoice, no problem! As long as you have an annual plan, we can update your account. To switch to invoicing: Make sure the info in your Billing Details is up to date—your billing email address, postal address, billing contact name, phone number, purchase order number, anything and everything that relates to your payment method. Contact us and let us know you'd like to switch to invoicing. Make sure you understand how invoicing works by reading the info at the top of this article. That's it! We'll send you an invoice to pay for your next renewal. Remember, you need to keep auto-renew turned on in your account. This means you’ll get your invoice 45 days before your next renewal. Auto-renew doesn’t mean we auto-charge you! It just means we can automatically email you an invoice that you can pay manually when the time comes.

Manage Accounts with SCIM,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/scim/,"Manage Accounts with SCIM | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Manage Accounts with SCIM Set Up SCIM Provisioning Revoke SCIM Provisioning SCIM FAQs Help Teams & Enterprise Managing Teams Manage Accounts with SCIM SurveyMonkey Manage Accounts with SCIM Manage Accounts with SCIM Set Up SCIM Provisioning Revoke SCIM Provisioning SCIM FAQs BETA FEATURE: This feature is only for Enterprise teams that have Single Sign-On (SSO) set up. To keep your team’s SurveyMonkey accounts up to date with information stored in an identity provider (IdP), such as Azure Active Directory, you can link the systems using the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM). This helps your IT department keep track of accounts across multiple platforms. If you have data stored in our European Data Center, this feature isn't available. You can see if this applies to you by checking your Account Details . Manage Accounts with SCIM When you set up account provisioning with SCIM, some account management features will change. Here’s what will be mapped, synced, and managed for each user in the identity provider: When someone joins or leaves your organization Username First and last name Email address Divisions (if set up for your team) Primary Admins and Admins will continue to manage the following within SurveyMonkey: Account reassignment Role and seat assignments Accounts that don’t have SSO enabled Account deletion TIP! Deactivate the team user through your IdP before reassigning or deleting the account. Set Up SCIM Provisioning Only the Primary Admin can set up SCIM provisioning for your organization. To make sure SCIM is a good fit for your IdP, the Primary Admin should check in with their SurveyMonkey Customer Success Manager (CSM) and their organization’s IT department—only 1 IdP per Enterprise team. Once the team is aligned, the Primary Admin can: Go to Settings . Select User provisioning with SCIM . Copy the SCIM endpoint link and provide it to your IT partner. Select Generate token . Treat this unique token as you would your Primary Admin password and only give it to your IT partner. Your organization’s IT partner will use the SCIM endpoint link and access token during set up of the IdP. They will also need to adjust the default mapping for your team’s needs. Mapping guide Below are mapping examples for your IT department to use with Azure Active Directory. Example IdP attributes SurveyMonkey SCIM Attributes * Mapping in SurveyMonkey userPrincipalName userName Display name IsSoftDeleted active Group member status mail emails[type eq ""work""].value Email address givenName name.givenName First name surname name.familyName Last name mailNickname externalId n/a employeeId urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:employeeNumber Employee ID department urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:division Divisions department urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department Department * Attributes help you track and monitor team activity in the SurveyMonkey User Repor t. All SCIM operations will be listed, including errors and failures. To confirm SCIM is set up properly, your IT partner should manually provision one user through the IdP. Then, have the Primary Admin check the SurveyMonkey Activity page to see if the provision is there. Revoke SCIM Provisioning If you need to disconnect Surveymonkey from your IdP so the systems no longer sync, the Primary Admin can revoke SCIM provisioning. As long as SSO is enabled, there will be no impact to users who have already been synced. To revoke the SCIM provisioning: Go to Settings . Select User provisioning with SCIM . Next to the access token, select Revoke . SCIM FAQs Below are common questions with potential solutions to help resolve them. Why can’t I delete an account? With SCIM enabled accounts, only deactivated team members can be deleted. Make sure that the user is deactivated through your IDP. If there's still an issue with deleting deactivated users from your team, reach out to your CSM. Why are former employees shown as active in my Enterprise team? Your IDP won't update past changes to SurveyMonkey. User deactivation only begins once SCIM is enabled, and so it won't deactivate users that were removed (former employees) before SCIM was applied. To remove these users, contact your CSM. Do deactivated accounts take up a license (seat)? Yes. An admin must delete a deactivated account to free up a seat . Why do I see so many invited users on the Manage Users page? Unless a user already has an SSO-enabled Enterprise account, any employee allowed to log in to SurveyMonkey using your organization’s corporate login credentials will show as an invited user on the Manage Users tab of My Team. With SCIM, an invited user isn't sent an invitation to join the Team, and so don't take up a seat. This means that users can join but haven't taken any action yet to convert or create an account . Why are members of my Enterprise team still showing as an invited user? Accounts which aren't SSO-enabled are shown as invited by SCIM on the Manage Users tab. For these users you will see them as both an invited user, and part of the team. Once the user converts their account to SSO, the invited user will be removed. TIP!

There are a few common ways to use HTML in your forms: Adding a link to your feedback form that links to your customer support pages. Adding an iframe to your feedback form that integrates Facebook on the end page Adding images to your campaign and asking for feedback about them Before You Start It’s best to have a basic understanding of HTML and GetFeedback implementation before enabling HTML in your web forms.

To enable HTML for your web forms and campaigns: In your web button form or campaign, add a Paragraph element. If needed, select the paragraph element to edit it. Check the box to Enable HTML. The sections below provide examples of common HTML use cases. Links Use hyperlinks to link to another web page from your form. You can also use links to open the respondent’s email program or dial a phone number when someone uses a phone to access your web page. Each link in HTML is surrounded by tags. The text you add between the tags will be displayed as the link. The code sample below shows several examples of the links you can use. Each element has properties that allow you to define the link style and specify how the link should be opened. View raw code here. Images Images can be helpful when you're trying to explain something or when you want to make your form more visual. Images in HTML use the tag.

Adding new users to a Wufoo account lets you work with a team to build forms, themes, and reports. To get to the User Management page, log in and go to Users. User Roles The type of information you can see or edit in an account depends on what your user role is. There are three types of users: Account Creator: The person who created the Wufoo account and has access to everything in the account. If you're the Account Creator, it says Account Creator under your name on the User Management page. Admin: People who have access to all forms, reports, and themes and can manage other users in the account. If you're an Admin, it says Admin under your name on the User Management page. User: Users (with a capital U) only have access to some forms, themes and reports in the account, depending on their permissions. If you're a User, you'll only see yourself listed on the User Management page. Permissions Account Creator Admin User Create new forms, reports, and themes ✅ ✅ Depends on permissions Edit existing forms, entries, reports, and themes ✅ ✅ Depends on permissions View users in the account & add, delete, and set up permissions for users ✅ ✅ Only sees their own user info and their permissions Access the Account Manager & Activity Log ✅ ✅ Edit the billing information for the account ✅ ✅ Users can only view, download, and copy links Add or delete files and folders to the File Manager ✅ ✅ Upgrade or cancel the account ✅ ❌ Change the subdomain for the account ✅ ❌ Managing Users The Account Creator and any Admins in an account can view and edit user info and permissions, as well as add and delete users. Adding Users The number of users you can add to an account depends on your plan, which you can see in the Account Manager. To add a user: Log in and go to Users . In the upper-right corner, click green +New User button. Type in the user's name and email address. No two users can have the same email address. Before you continue, read over the info on logging in. It's important to remember Admins and Users in an account need to log in using the unique Account Login Link —they can't log in directly from the Wufoo home page. Click Create User . We'll send an email to your new Wufoo friend with their login details. Set up the user's permissions—by default, people you add to your account can't access anything until you grant them permissions. Duplicating Users You can create a new user by duplicating an existing user. This is a great way to add a new user to the account when you want them to have the exact same permissions as someone else. To duplicate a user: Log in and go to Users . In the Your Users box on the left, click the green circle with the plus sign next to the user you want to duplicate. Deleting Users To delete a user: Log in and go to Users . In the Your Users box on the left, click the red circle next to the user you want to delete. Confirm that you want to delete the user. Once you confirm, they're no longer able to log in to the account. We don't email them to let them know—we'll leave that up to you. TIP! You can't delete the Account Creator, but the Account Create can update their name and email address to transfer the account to someone else. Setting Up Permissions When you add a user to an account, by default they have no permissions, but you can set them up in no time. Creating an Admin To give someone the most access possible, make them an Admin: Log in and go to Users . In the Your Users box on the left, click the user. Underneath their email address in the middle of the page, check the box for Administrator . Click Save Profile . Adding Permissions To choose the permissions someone has: Log in and go to Users . In the Your Users box, click the user. In the blue box labeled This User Can Do the Following , check the boxes to allow them to create new forms, reports, or themes. In the green box labeled This User Can Access , click the Add Permissions button. Choose the forms, reports, and themes you'd like them to be able to access, and click Save Permissions . Use the dropdown menu to give them permission to view and edit the form or just to view it. In the yellow box in the middle, Click Save Profile . If a user has permission to create new forms, they will be granted full permissions for any new forms they create. Editing User Info Any User can edit their own user information. To edit someone else's info, you need to be the Account Creator or an Admin on the account. Only the Account Creator can edit their own info. Log in and go to Users . In the Your Users box, click the user. In the yellow box with user info, edit the info. Under Confirm Your Password , enter in your password—Not the user password. Click Save Profile . Common Questions Why can't I save when editing user info? Make sure to enter in your password in the Confirm Your Password box instead of the password of the user. Then click Save Profile to save your changes. Why can't I log in? If you were added as a user to a Wufoo account, you need to log in using the Account Login Link you were emailed—you can't log in from the Wufoo homepage. How many users can be logged in at a time? Everyone in an account can be logged in at the same time. However, only one person should be editing a particular form or report at a time. If two people edit the same page at the same time, changes made by whoever clicked Save last would overwrite any changes made by another user. Why can't I find a form or report or make my own? You probably don't have permissions. Contact the Account Creator or an Admin in the account who can help you out. How can I change the owner of my account? You can change the owner of your account if you're logged in as the creator. To change ownership of your account: Log in and go to Users . In the Your Users box, click the Account Creator. In the yellow box with user info, edit the Name and Email Address. Click Save Profile . Once you've changed the account owner, you can update the billing info with the details of the new account owner.

What happens when I accept/decline a recommendation? When the request has been accepted or declined, the applicant will be informed within their applicant portal. That way if the request is declined they will be able to send a new request to another recommender. Depending on the site configurations by the administrators of the site, they may also be sent an email to inform them of the decision. If you decline the recommendation request, no further steps will be required of you. If you accept the recommendation request, you will be prompted to complete and submit the recommendation task on behalf of the applicant. I am having trouble attaching my recommendation Depending on site configurations put in place by the administrators, they may request that you attach a file for the recommendation, as opposed to filling out an internal form. If you have been requested to attach a file but are experiencing difficulties there are a few potential reasons this may occur. The file is not in an available format. Check to ensure that the file type you are trying to attach is one of the accepted formats in the site. The file is encrypted SurveyMonkey Apply will not accept encrypted files. In order to attach your file, it will need to be un-encrypted. The file is corrupted It is possible that the file you are trying to attach is a corrupted file. In order to resolve the issue, re-save the file to a new folder on your computer and attempt to attach the file again. A task related issue. Depending on the issue it is also possible that the error is related to another setting on the task. For example, you are unable to edit the task. Can I view/download the application that was submitted by the applicant? Whether or not you can view/download the application will mainly depend on the configurations of the site by the administrative team. If the functionality has been enabled: Click to View the recommendation for that applicant Click Preview Application Can the applicant see my recommendation? Whether or not the applicant can view your recommendation will depend on the configurations put in place by the administrators of the site. If you wish to inquire more in regards to this we would recommend reaching out to the administrators. Email FAQs I didn't receive an email invite, what should I do? If you have spoken with the applicant who requested the recommendation and they have informed you of the invite, but you have not received an email from the site you can perform the following steps to resolve the issue: 1. Reach out to the applicant and confirm that they have sent the invite to the correct email address and there are no spelling errors. If the information is correct 2. Check your Spam/Junk Folder. Sometimes these emails can get stuck in the spam/junk folder, depending on your email service provider's spam/security settings. If you are unable to locate the email in any inbox 3. Have the applicant Resend the Invitation. Once the applicant has resent the invite you can repeat step 2, if necessary. If the above options don't work: 4. You can contact our support team . It is important that you contact us yourself with no additional recipients on the email. Once we receive your email we will be able to assist you with logging into the site. Quick Reference FAQs What is the difference between the traditional Recommendation experience and Quick Reference? The traditional recommendation experience required Recommenders to create an account or log in to an existing SurveyMonkey Apply account to provide recommendations for applicants. Quick Reference on the other hand allows Recommenders to leverage secure, one-time links to provide recommendations for applicants. How long are the secure, one-time links valid? Secure, one-time links sent to Recommenders are valid for 14 days OR when the Recommendation Task has been completed OR when the task/stage deadline has elapsed. NOTE: ""One-time"" links do not expire the first time they're used and are accessible during the full 14-day time period. However, since these links are on a per-recommendation basis, once the recommendation has been completed, it will no longer direct to that QR. How does Quick Reference change the Recommendation experience of our users? Administrators: In terms of the SMA Admin User Interface, the change is minimal; We’ve added an option for the SMA Admin to enable “Quick Reference” as part of the Recommendation Process. Applicants: The User Interface and Flow for the Applicant will not change. They will still enter the first name, last name, and email address of the recommender to start the process. Recommender: The User Interface for the Recommender will not change other than it will circumvent the registration/login process if Quick Reference is enabled and limit their view to the specific Recommendation they are accessing. Reviewers: Enabling Quick Reference will have no change to the Reviewer Experience; Reviewers will still be able to view Recommendation documents as usual. How do I change my Recommendation Task to leverage Quick Reference? Start by navigating to your Program Workflow, open up the task settings for your Recommendation Task, and enable “Quick Reference”. Please note: this setting is on the task level, which means if you wish all of your Recommendation Tasks (in the same program or others) to leverage this functionality, each task will need to be updated. Will enabling or disabling Quick Reference impact any recommendations I’ve already received? No. Enabling or Disabling Quick Reference will not impact any of the recommendations you have already received. Can I enable/disable Quick Reference while my program is live? Yes. Enabling or Disabling Quick Reference is possible even after your Program has gone live, and will have no negative impact on your process.

Adding a Quota,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/quotas/,"Adding a Quota | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview Designing Quota Questions Terminology Adding a Quota Viewing Quota Results Help Creating Surveys Applying Logic Adding a Quota SurveyMonkey Adding a Quota Video Overview Designing Quota Questions Terminology Adding a Quota Viewing Quota Results Quotas Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free A quota limits the number of people who can take your survey. It helps you get a balanced sample of specific responses and the exact amount of data you need. Once your quota is met, the collector closes so no one else can take your survey. Then you can see the complete results of your quota in your results. Video Overview Designing Quota Questions First, create the survey questions you want to add a quota to using only these supported question types : Multiple Choice Checkboxes Dropdown Menu We suggest adding 1–3 questions with answer choices that help you identify who you want to get responses from. Check out the Video Overview for examples. Terminology Get to know some of the terms you'll encounter when building your quota. Term Definition Simple Quota A type of quota. A Simple Quota lets you use 1 qualifying question in your survey to set limits for how many people can answer with specific answers. You can set limits for one or more Answer Groups from any 1 question. Combination Quota A type of quota. A Combination Quota lets you automatically close your survey once you receive a specific combination of responses across 2 to 3 questions in your survey. Quota Label Field The field where you name your Simple or Combination Quota. The label could be representative of your desired target respondent base. Answer Group Label You can name each Answer Group you create for your quota. This label represents how a someone will answer your qualifying question(s). Answer Groups These are the answer selections you need people to select when taking your survey. Answer Groups can include a single answer choice or multiple answer choices on any single question. A quota can have 1 or more Answer Groups, like in a checkboxes question. Each Answer Group limit needs to be met before your quota is met and the collector closes. Assign Values You Assign Values to combine Answer Groups from your 2–3 questions in a Combination Quota. Once the Answer Groups are selected, you'll set the limit of responses needed with that exact Answer Group combination. You can't Assign Values on a Simple Quota. Equations You can add additional equations, which allow you to Assign Values to other Answer Groups in your Combination Quota. Equations aren't used on a Simple Quota. Quota Options You can control what the over-quota survey takers see after answering your quota questions. Adding a Quota Once your survey design is complete, you're ready to add your quota. There’s a limit of one quota per survey. If you're not sure if a Simple Quota or Combination Quota is best for you, check out the Terminology section above. Expand | Collapse Adding a Simple Quota To apply your Simple Quota: Go to the Design Survey section. In the left sidebar, click the Logic icon. Click Quota . Click Simple Quota . Edit the Quota Label . Select a Question . Pick the page and question that you’ll base your quota on. Click Next . Edit the Answer Group Label . Choose a label that represents the answer choice or choices you’re setting the limit for. Select your Answer Group. In the Quota field, edit the number of people you want to take your survey and respond with the selected answer(s). Click Save . Your Answer Group Label displays with a summary of the number of collected responses and the number of desired responses. (Optional) If you want to add additional Answer Group limits to your Simple Quota, click + Answer Group and repeat steps 8–11. Once you have your Answer Group(s) set up, click the Options button. Select what survey takers see after the quota is met and click Save . Click Done . Adding a Combination Quota To apply a Combination Quota: Go to the Design Survey section. In the left sidebar, click the Logic icon. Click Quota . Click Combination Quota . Edit the Quota Label . Select Questions . Pick 2–3 questions to base your quota on. Click Next . Edit the Answer Group Label for your first question—choose a label that represents the answer choice or choices you’re setting the limit for. Select choices for the Answer Group. Click Save . Click + Answer Group to your second and third questions. Add at least 1 answer group for each question in the Combination Quota. You can add more than 1 answer group to any question in your quota. Once all Answer Groups are set for each Quota question, click Assign Values . To make an equation, choose the Answer Groups you want to combine and edit the number of people who you want to take your survey in that answer group in the Quota field. Click Save . (Optional) Select + Add Equation to create any other set limits for your survey. Click Save . Your Answer Group Label displays with a summary of the number of collected responses and the number of desired respondents. Once you have your target demographics captured by your Answer Group(s), click the Options button. Select what survey takers see after the quota is met and click Save . Click Done . If you add a quota to your survey, you can't embed your first question in an email invitation . You can't add a quota to your survey if you plan to purchase SurveyMonkey Audience responses. Instead, use multiple Audience collectors to reach the respondent sampling you need. Quota Options You can edit the quota options to choose what survey takers see after submitting an answer that exceeds a quota limit. You can also edit the survey closed message for people who try to take the survey after it's closed. Option Description End the survey They proceed to the Survey End Page . Display a custom message They see the custom message you entered. Redirect to your own webpage They are redirected to the URL you entered. Close window Their browser window closes. The font formatting used for a quota's custom message can be controlled by setting the Answer choice font setting . Live Surveys If your survey is live—meaning it already has responses—you can still edit or apply a quota. When you apply a quota to a live survey, existing responses don’t count towards the quota, only new responses do. If your survey closed because the quota was met, you can adjust the quota to accept more qualified responses. You also need to reopen the collector so more people can take your survey. Viewing Quota Results When you're ready to view your quota results, head over to the Analyze Results section. The Quota status bar lets you know how close your quota is to being met. Saved Views When a quota is applied to a survey, a saved view is created for each set of qualified responses. If you have more than one limit set up on your quota, you'll have multiple saved views. When you select a saved view, it displays a filtered view of only the Complete responses within that quota limit. To select a saved view: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. In the left sidebar, click Saved Views . Click the name of the view. A green check mark ✅ next to a view means the view is selected. You can toggle a view on and off by clicking its name. Don't edit the filters in these saved views, since there isn't a way to revert back to the original saved view. If you want to add additional filters, use the Original View and build your filters from scratch. Exporting Quota Responses To export quota responses: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Click E Saved Views . Click the More icon ( ... ) next to the quota view you want to export. Select Export view . Choose Summary data or All responses data . Select the file format and settings you want. Click Export . Response Status In the Individual Responses tab of the Analyze Results section, you'll see the Response Status for each respondent. Only Complete responses count towards your quota and are included in your Saved View. Over Quota and Incomplete responses aren't included in your Quota. Deleting Responses If you delete an individual response that counted towards your quota, the quota is still considered met. If you want to collect more qualified responses, increase your quota.

Collecting Payments Through Your Form,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/build/collect-payment/,"Collecting Payments Through Your Form | Wufoo Help Log in Wufoo In this article Merchant Setup Payment Options Assign Prices Managing Your Payment Form Help Build a Form Managing Forms Collecting Payments Through Your Form Wufoo Collecting Payments Through Your Form Merchant Setup Payment Options Assign Prices Managing Your Payment Form PAID FEATURE: Collecting payments is only available on some paid plans—see if it’s on your plan . You can collect payments from people who fill out your form by integrating with one of our partnered merchants. To collect payments through a form, or to access the Payment Settings page for an existing payment form: Log in and go to Forms . To the right of the form, If you're using legacy Wufoo, click Payments . If you're using the new Wufoo experience , click the View Payments icon (cart). In the Merchant Setup section, choose and authenticate the merchant you want to use to collect payments (for example, Stripe). In the Payment Options section, choose the currency you want people to pay you with, and configure any of the optional settings. In the Assign Prices section, set the prices for your form so Wufoo knows how much to charge the people that submit your form. Select Enable Payment in the upper-right corner of the page. Click Save Settings . Merchant Setup A merchant is the third-party payment processor that will process your transactions and settle your payments. Choosing the Right Merchant for You There's lots to consider when choosing a merchant. Compare the features available with each merchant to make sure you choose the one that works best for you: Choosing a Merchant Authenticating Your Account Once you choose the merchant you want, the information you'll need to enter to link your merchant account to Wufoo is different depending on the merchant you choose. The following articles include an overview of how each payment integration works and how to set it up in Wufoo: Stripe Square Stripe Subscription Billing Braintree PayPal Standard PayPal Website Payments Pro PayPal Payflow Pro Authorize.Net USA ePay Payment Options Payment Options are the settings that control things like what fields appear on the payment page, who gets receipts, what info those receipts include, and more. Available payment options vary by merchant. List of Payment Options & Descriptions Payment Option Description Currency Determines the currency of the payments you'll receive, which will be reflected on the payment page. You can only set one currency per form. Set up Recurring Billing Set the frequency at which you want to request payment from the people that submit your form. This Payment Option is only available in the Wufoo UI if you're using PayPal Standard , but you can also set up recurring billing with Stripe Subscription Billing , outside of Wufoo. Collect Shipping Address Adds a shipping address section to the payment page where people can select a ""Same as Billing Address"" checkbox if their billing and shipping address are the same, or they can enter a different shipping address. Email Receipt to User Adds an ""Email Receipt To:"" field to the payment page, where people can specify an email address to send a copy of their receipt to. You can also use Templating to customize the receipt emails with information specific to the person's entry, and other form and transaction metadata, like the unique ID for the transaction, or the purchase total. Email Copy of Receipt to Me Enter your email address to receive a copy of each receipt to your inbox. If you want to send receipts to more people, you can enter up to 20 email addresses in this field, separated by commas. Limit Card Types Accepted This setting only controls which credit card icons show on your form, but it doesn’t block other card types from being accepted. For example, if you hide Discover, someone could still enter a Discover card number and successfully submit the form. If you want to block certain card types from being accepted, you need to do that on the merchant side. Allow for Coupons Adds a field to your payment page where people can enter a coupon code to get a discount. You'll need to set up the coupon codes in Stripe (Subscription Billing only). If you're using a different merchant but would still like to set up a coupon code system, you can assign negative prices to certain fields in your form, and use the Rule Builder to create a dynamic coupon system. Learn more on our blog: How to Create a Coupon System for Your Wufoo Payment Forms Allow for eCheck Payments Adds the ability to accept payments from consumer and corporate bank accounts, via eCheck.net. Your Authorize.Net account must be specifically configured to accept eChecks to use this payment option. Email Invoice to User Automatically emails a Freshbooks invoice to the client after they submit your form. The invoice will be sent to the email address they entered in your form, so make sure you've included an Email field. If you leave the Email Invoice to User option deselected, instead you'll just need to manually review invoices in your Freshbooks account before sending them off to your clients. Pre-Populate Billing Info Pulls the answers from the Name, Address, and Email fields on the form and pre-populates them into the Credit Card Name, Billing Address, and Email fields on the payment page. People filling out the payment page will still be able to edit these fields if they need to. Show Running Total Adds a running total to the form itself, so people filling out your form can see their total before proceeding to the payment page. Assign Prices Assigning prices tells Wufoo what to charge the people who fill out your form. You can set a fixed amount that everyone needs to pay as the minimum fee, assign prices to individual fields on your form, or both. For example, if you're building a registration form and everyone needs to pay the same minimum registration fee, you could set a Fixed Amount. If there are optional add-ons or special tickets that cost extra, you can also assign prices to individual fields on your form that people may select to sign up for those options. Setting a Fixed Base Price A fixed amount is a base price that everyone needs to pay if they submit your form, regardless of what answers they select. To set a fixed amount: In the Fixed Amount field, enter a name for base fee. This name is what appears on the running total as people fill out your form, and on receipts. Enter a price into the $ textbox. This is the price that every person that submits your form will be charged on the payment page. In the Fixed Amount field, enter the amount you want to charge every person that submits an entry to your form, regardless of what answers they select. If you don't want to charge a base price, set this field to 0. Assigning Prices to Individual Fields You can assign prices to answer choices from Dropdown, Multiple Choice, Checkboxes, or Price fields. Price Fields Since Price fields let people enter their own price, you don't have to assign your own prices to these fields. However, you do need to enable payment for them so that the prices people enter will register with your payment integration. To enable payments for a Price field: First, make sure the Currency Format you selected in the Field Settings of the Price Field matches the Currency you selected in the Payment Options. Go back to the Payments Settings page by clicking Payments next to your form in the Form Manager. From the Assign Prices to a Field dropdown, select the Price field from your form. Dropdown, Multiple Choice, and Checkboxes Fields To assign prices to these field types: From the Assign Prices to a Field dropdown, select a field from your form. In the textbox next to each answer choice, enter the price you want to assign to that choice. This can either be a positive or negative number (just add a - before the price to make it negative): If you enter a positive number , and someone chooses that answer choice when they fill out your form, the price associated with that choice will be added to their total. If you enter a negative number , and someone chooses that answer choice when they fill out your form, the price associated with that choice will be deducted from their total. If you enter 0.00 , and someone chooses that answer choice when they fill out your form, their total won't be affected either way. Repeat steps 1 & 2 for any other fields you want to assign prices to. Allowing People to Buy More Than 1 of Something There's no way to add a quantity dropdown next to a field, but you can use a Dropdown or Multiple Choice field to offer different quantities, and then assign prices to each quantity. Learn more: How to Be Even More Clever with Quantity Fields Adding Tax or Shipping Costs At this time there's no way to add taxes or shipping costs, but you can take these added costs into account when you assign prices. If you want to add tax, we recommend adding that percentage of tax to the price of each item in your form. Managing Your Payment Form Once you share your payment form with the world, here's what you need to know about managing your payment form moving forward. Disabling Payments If you want to stop collecting payments on a form, you can disable payment at any time: Click Forms at the top of any page. Click Payment under the form. Deselect Enable Payment in the upper-right corner of the page. Click Save Settings . If you ever want to re-enable payments, we'll remember your payment settings so it's easy to start collecting payments again. Monitoring Payment Status in the Entry Manager To view the payment status for an entry: Click Forms at the top of any page. Click Entries under the form you want to check. Click See all entries . Click an entry in the table—the payment status will be listed on the right side of the page. Payment Info Description Amount This is the total amount that was charged, regardless of whether or not the charge was actually paid. Status This tells you if the charge was paid, unpaid, or denied. By default, the status of any submission will be “Unpaid”. If your merchant account is set up to notify Wufoo, the status of the submission will be updated as it's either processed or denied by the merchant. You can manually change the payment status by clicking on it. Confirmation All merchants create a transaction or confirmation number for a payment. You can also include payment status information in the datagrid widget on a report.

How to Lock/Unlock Applications,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/lock-unlock-app/,"How to Lock/Unlock Applications | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What Does Locking/Unlocking Applications Do? Manually Locking/Unlocking Applications Help Monitor Manage Applications How to Lock/Unlock Applications Apply How to Lock/Unlock Applications What Does Locking/Unlocking Applications Do? Manually Locking/Unlocking Applications While your application is launched and you are accepting applications, it may be necessary to lock an application to prevent a user from continuing to work on tasks. This article covers how to lock and unlock applications within your site. What Does Locking/Unlocking Applications Do? The ability to lock and unlock applications allows administrators to stop applicants from continuing with their application until further notice. An application lock can be applied to or removed from applications individually, in batches, or through the use of automations. Locked applications can only be unlocked by an automation or administrator. Some general use cases follow: Case 1 - Resolve a Workflow Issue After a program has been launched your applicants may bring issues to your attention that were not caught during testing. By manually locking all active applications temporarily you can halt further progress until the program workflow issues have been resolved. Case 2 - Verify an Application While monitoring applications you may find that an applicant has answered eligibility questions correctly, but are not truly eligible to apply based on responses collected within their application. By locking the application it will give the administrator a chance to reach out to the applicant and verify their information and eligibility before allowing them to progress in the application process. Case 3 - Lock Applications Based on Form Responses In some cases, the eligibility quiz may not be the most logical place for eligibility type questions. Using automations, applications can be locked based on specific responses given within a form. Manually Locking/Unlocking Applications Lock Applications To manually lock application(s): Go to Manage Applications . Select the application(s) to lock from further editing. Select More . Select Lock . Unlock Applications To manually unlock application(s): Go to Manage Applications . Select the application(s) to unlock and allow editing again. Select More . Select Unlock . Using Automations to Lock/Unlock Applications Applications are commonly locked based on a response given within a form task. Instead of monitoring answers to these questions and manually locking applications that have given a particular response, you can use an automation to perform that action for you. Locking an Application Based on a Form Response Unlock an Application when moved to a New Stage Locking an Application Based on a Form Response Example: An application form contains a question asking how many years the student has been in College/ University, in order to proceed the applicant will need to response one year and above. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Task A Task has been Edited after Completion Application Form CONDITIONS Match ALL conditions Application Form How many years have you completed in College/ University? is exactly Under one year DO Action Source Action Application Lock the Application Unlock an Application when moved to a New Stage Example: This example shows how to unlock the application when it is moved to a new stage. In this example, select applications are manually locked by an administrator while they verify the application material. If changes need to be made the administrator will move the application to a new application stage titled Applicant Follow-Up and the automation would perform the unlock action automatically. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Application has changed state Applicant Follow-Up CONDITIONS Not required for this scenario DO Action Source Action Application Unlock the application Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

How to Analyze Results,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/analyzing-results/,"How to Analyze Results | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Video Overview Viewing Responses Using Rules to Analyze Data Exports Help Analyzing Results Understanding Your Results How to Analyze Results SurveyMonkey How to Analyze Results Video Overview Viewing Responses Using Rules to Analyze Data Exports You can view and analyze your results at any time during the collection process in the Analyze section of the survey. Here you can see a summary view of your data; browse individual responses; create and export dynamic charts; use filter, compare, and show rules to analyze specific data views and segments; view and categorize open-ended responses, and easily download your results in multiple formats. Video Overview Viewing Responses You can view summaries of each survey question, or browse through individual survey responses. Expand | Collapse Question Summaries We're updating the look and feel of your charts, so you may notice some differences over time. We appreciate your patience as we improve SurveyMonkey! Viewing Question Summaries , the default Analyze view, gives you quick insight into the overall results of your survey. For close-ended questions, dynamic charts are generated automatically for visual analysis. Question Summaries only shows responses from the first 10 pages of your survey. If you have more than 10 pages, export your responses to view all results. Individual Responses Viewing Individual Responses is useful if you'd like to view each respondent's complete set of answers to your survey. You can view all responses in a table or scroll through each response one by one. Additionally, each individual response includes respondent metadata, giving you more insight into: Who submitted the response (if you tracked responses ) The collector through which the response was submitted The start and end date and time The time spent entering a response Response completeness The IP address of the respondent To browse individual responses, click the Individual Responses tab toward the top of the Analyze page. Scroll through the table to view your responses. Or, switch to Single view, then use the left and right arrows to navigate through each response. Learn more: Viewing Individual Responses Open-ended Responses You can view open-ended responses under the Question Summaries tab and under the Individual Responses tab. When you view an open-ended question in the Question Summaries area, you may need to click the Responses link to view all responses. With some paid plans, you can use the text analysis features to identify and tag recurring words or themes in your responses.

Or, compare results from different groups of respondents. Learn more: Analyze Multiple Surveys Together Using Rules to Analyze Data After viewing the overall Question Summaries, you can create rules to answer more specific questions about your data. Filter, Compare, and Show rules allow you to focus in on specific subsets of your data, so you can analyze your results in a way that's most meaningful to you. Paid users may create an unlimited number of rules. Free users may create one rule. Expand | Collapse Filter Rules Use filter rules to focus on a specific subset of your data based on certain criteria that you define. When a filter is applied, only results that meet that criteria will show in the filtered view. Filters carry over to both the Question Summaries and Individual Responses tabs. For example, if you only want to view responses submitted within a certain time frame, create a Filter by Time Period. If you only want to see responses from Females who submitted responses within that time frame, create a Filter by Question & Answer and apply both filters at once. You can filter your results by: Question & Answer Collector Completeness Time Period Respondent Metadata To create a Filter rule, click Rules , then click +FILTER in the left sidebar. Learn More: Filter Rules Compare Rules Compare rules allow you to cross-tabulate your data to compare the answer choices to one question across the rest of the survey. In statistical terms, it is a joint distribution between two (or more) discrete variables such as product usage and demographics. For example, if you included a survey question asking respondents to select their gender, you can create a Compare rule to cross-tabulate and compare the survey results from each gender side by side. To create a Compare rule, click Rules , then click +COMPARE in the left sidebar. Learn More: Compare Rules Show Rules You can use Show rules to display only certain survey questions or pages in the result summary. If you're only interested in analyzing certain questions or pages in your survey at a time, creating a Show rule will help you focus on those parts of the survey without the clutter of the rest of your survey. For example, if you used skip logic in your survey to direct certain respondents to different questions based on their answers to previous questions, you can create a Show rule that contains only the questions included in that logic path for easier analysis. To create a Show rule, click Rules , then click +SHOW in the left sidebar. Learn More: Show Rules Using Saved Views A View is a snapshot of your data made up of any Filter, Compare, or Show rules that you apply to the survey results. With any paid plan, you can save views so that you can easily toggle back and forth between different views of your data at any time, without having to constantly recreate them. Learn More: Views Exports With any paid plan, you can download your results in a variety of formats. You can keep an offline copy of your survey results, send the exports to others, download individual responses for printing, or export your raw data for further analysis. Exports are available on paid plans. Expand | Collapse Summary Data Summary data exports contain the response percentages, response counts, and open-ended responses (optional).

How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/change-live-form/,"How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is a Live Form? How is Information Stored? What Can I Alter Safely? Conditional Changes Adding a New Question to a Live Form Help Build Forms How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form Apply How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form What is a Live Form? How is Information Stored? What Can I Alter Safely? Conditional Changes Adding a New Question to a Live Form Whether you have decided to make some small changes, or are overhauling a form between application periods, the possibility of losing currently submitted information as a result of form changes can sometimes lead to cluttered workflows and reports. This guide aims to help administrators know what they can and cannot safely edit within a live form during and after data collection. What is a Live Form? A live form is a form that has collected data at any point in the lifecycle of your site regardless if those responses belong to applicants that are currently accessing your site, applicants that completed the form in a previous cycle, or test applications you created as an administrator to test the form. How is Information Stored? The reason we caution against making major changes to a form as detailed below is that each response that a user gives is stored within the form and within each individual question and choice. For example, within a form you have a question ""What is your favourite colour?"" and you have a dropdown with a list of colour choices. If the applicant selects ""Blue"" as their response, that response is stored within the specific choice of the dropdown. For example: Choice 1: Red Choice 2: Blue Choice 3: Green Choice 4: Yellow Choice 5: Purple So when you are pulling reports or piping information to an email or form, that response is retrievable through the choice selected. If you were to then remove Blue as an option from the list, that applicant's response would also be deleted and would not be available as the labels would shift to meet the new choices available: Choice 1: Red Choice 2: Green Blue Choice 3: Yellow Green Choice 4: Purple Yellow Choice 5: Purple (blank) If you were to pull a report you may notice that depending on where the choice was in the list, the response will either be blank or perhaps the data would be skewed and you may actually see a different colour as the selection of the user. For example, as Green has now become the label for Choice 2, and our applicant has selected Choice 2 as their response, the response in the site would now be Green which is inaccurate information. The same would occur if you were to delete the entire question from the form. As there is no longer a question in the site to store the data that information would no longer be accessible within the site. What Can I Alter Safely? Firstly, editing the contents of a form will not prevent your applicants from accessing or completing the form. In cases where applicants have already completed the form you are making changes to, the complete status will be retained through changes. When you are making alterations to the contents of a form, here are some examples of harmless actions: Adding a completely new question to any page Applying Options or Display settings to an existing question (i.e. sort alphabetically) Moving whole questions within the same page (contents of a question should not be reorganized) Re-ordering pages Editing styling to the form or question (e.g. font size, width, etc.) Editing text descriptions (e.g. Updating dates/years within your question titles and descriptions, correcting typos) What Changes Will Negatively Impact my Form? Here is a list of absolutely ""do not do's"" for form editing. The changes below have the ability to remove your data, and while in some cases changes can be reverted, this is not always the case and can cause even more issues to arise. Do not do Warning Deleting questions or individual question choices WARNING! This will delete existing responses to the question Editing choice/variable labels WARNING! When you update a choice or variable label, it will automatically update every application where that choice is selected so that the new text is reflected. In some cases, this is fine - like fixing a typo, but refrain from making full list updates. In this case, a new question or a duplicate of the form is most beneficial. You can refer above to How is Information Stored for more information. Deleting current choices/variables WARNING! This kind of change will cause a shift in your collected data. When a choice is deleted, all choice options after it bump up to fill the gap. Someone who correctly selects the label for Choice 2, may end up with what Choice 3 was previously labelled as when you go to export results or perform reviews. Conditional Changes Some changes to forms can be considered safe, or cause issues, depending on how you apply them. The most common examples follow. Adding a new choice or variable to an existing question SAFE USE: When you add a new choice or variable to an existing question at the very end of a list, it will be integrated into the question without issue. Before After - Choice 1: Red - Choice 2: Blue - Choice 3: Green - Choice 4: Yellow - Choice 5: Purple - Choice 1: Red - Choice 2: Blue - Choice 3: Green - Choice 4: Yellow - Choice 5: Purple - Choice 6: Pink DO NOT DO: Add a choice or variable to the middle of the list. There is a unique way our system interprets choices entered in closed-ended questions that can cause the data to be skewed if the choice is added to the middle of the choice list. As described above in How is Information is Stored , the selections that the users make are based on the Choice number (i.e. Choice 2) and not the label (""Blue""). Therefore, if you add a new choice above ""Choice 2: Blue,"" Blue will now become the 3rd choice on the list. Before After - Choice 1: Red - Choice 2: Blue - Choice 3: Green - Choice 4: Yellow - Choice 5: Purple - Choice 1: Red - Choice 2: Pink Blue - Choice 3: Blue Green - Choice 4: Green Yellow - Choice 5: Yellow Purple - Choice 6: Purple Creating and removing Branching Logic from forms SAFE USE: Making updates to Branching Logic is a generally safe practice. You can add/edit/remove your branching as you desire without affecting Data. However, it is important to be mindful of 'loops' in your branching. If something is set up in such a way that applicants cannot navigate forward (i.e. marking a required question as invalid entry regardless if it does or does not have a response) it will completely prevent your applicants from moving forward and can be a very frustrating experience. We do not check for these kinds of loops, so you will still be able to save the form if they are present. DO NOT DO: It is very important to keep in mind that branching can only exist because of the questions and content of your form. If you need to delete questions or choices, always make sure to remove branching logic prior to the form change, as it can have some undesired effects on accessibility. Additionally, keep in mind that a 'branching loop' can also cause issues. This is when one branching rule is attempting to perform conflicting actions. For example, trying to both hide and show a task as a result of the same condition, the form will not know what action to take. Adding a New Question to a Live Form New questions can be safely added to a form without affecting previously collected data. For more information on how to add a question please refer to How to Add a Question . NOTE: When you perform this action on a form that already has collected live responses, any user that has completed this task previously will not be asked to come back to the form and update their response. It will remain under the 'Complete' status, and the user will not automatically be informed a change in the form has taken place. Should an applicant need to go back and fill that out, we would recommend contacting the applicant and informing them of the change.

Questions that a respondent didn't answer are marked as skipped in the Analyze Results section. Even if you make a question required to answer , you may see when analyzing your results that respondents have skipped the question. There are several ways this can happen: Skip Logic Took the Respondent Past the Question If you included Skip Logic in your survey design, you may be skipping respondents past required questions. Even if a respondent never reaches a question due to skip logic, the question will still appear in their individual response as skipped. Respondent Exited the Survey Early If a respondent exits the survey before clicking the Done button, they may never reach some of your required questions.

You’ll add this to your website after installing the VWO smart code and the GetFeedback for Web installation snippet on your page. TIP! An easy way to manage this is to use a tag management system with tag sequencing. View raw code here. This code has not been tested for Single Page Application websites and GetFeedback support cannot provide help for this use case. Because we're using custom variables to push VWO test data to GetFeedback for Web, we'll need to make sure we don't overwrite any existing values. We recommend that you use a JavaScript object to initialize and manage your custom variables. This lets you push updated data by reinitializing the JavaScript object instead of redefining the values. How to use the VWO test data Once you've set up the integration, when a VWO test is running, you'll see custom VWO data added to your feedback results. The labels for this data can be changed through the integration code provided above. With this new data, you’ll be able to filter and segment your feedback items or campaign results by VWO test using Custom Variable filters. You can target campaigns based on your VWO test data using custom variables, as well. More information about targeting campaigns using custom variables can be found here .

How to Convert a Value to Two Floating Points (REALTWO),https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/convert-to-realtwo/,"How to Convert a Value to Two Floating Points (REALTWO) | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What is the REALTWO Function? Proper Formatting of REALTWO Expressions Help Advanced Features How to Convert a Value to Two Floating Points (REALTWO) Apply How to Convert a Value to Two Floating Points (REALTWO) What is the REALTWO Function? Proper Formatting of REALTWO Expressions Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. Using the REALTWO expression, results are displayed with two floating points (1.00, 2.50, 3.14, etc.). This article describes this expression further by providing use cases and rules for proper formatting. What is the REALTWO Function? The REAL function allows the expression to convert a set of values into a floating point or real value for either a single value or a list of values from a number of given fields. The difference between REAL and REALTWO is that REALTWO returns the value with two decimal places (1.00) whereas REAL converts the value to a single decimal place (1.0). Additionally, if you are looking to have more than two decimal places within your response, you will need to use PRECISION instead. TIP! REALTWO can be useful when calculating monetary values. Proper Formatting of REALTWO Expressions The setup and formatting of the REALTWO expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the REALTWO expression should be set up as follows: {{ REALTWO(variable1+variable2) }} Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of REALTWO and the last bracket Variables you are using are case sensitive Always close the REALTWO operation with brackets ( ) What's different of REALTWO over some of the other functions is that REALTWO can be used in conjunction with other functions. For example, using the AVG function, if we want to calculate the average of 3 values, should that value return a floating point, REALTWO can be used to ensure the value displays up to 2 decimal points. REALTWO using addition {{ REALTWO(q1[0]+q1[1]) }} Ensures that the sum of q1[0] and q1[1] displays up to a two decimal places. REALTWO using subtraction {{ REALTWO(q2[1]-q1[0]) }} Ensures that the difference of q2[1] and q1[0] displays up to a two decimal places. REALTWO using multiplication {{ REALTWO(q1[1]*2) }} OR{{ REALTWO(q1[2]*q2[0]) }} Ensures the product of the multiplied values displays up to two decimal places. REALTWO using division {{ REALTWO(q1[3]/4) }} OR{{ REALTWO(q2[0]/q1[1]) }} Ensures the quotient of the divided values displays up to two decimal places. REALTWO on another function {{ REALTWO(SUM(q1[:0])) }} OR{{ REALTWO(AVG(q1[0],q1[2],q1[3]) }} Ensure the result of the expression using another function displays up to two decimal places. REALTWO will not round the value to the nearest number, it will simply remove any additional floating points to meet the Rule, therefore 1.659 will be 1.65 and not 1.66.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/integrations/salesforce-map-multiple-surveys/,"SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Build Page Layouts Create Record Types Map to a Record Type in SurveyMonkey Help Integrations SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object SurveyMonkey SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object Build Page Layouts Create Record Types Map to a Record Type in SurveyMonkey Get the integration ! SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. The SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration allows you to map survey data to fields on Salesforce objects. However, if you map multiple surveys to the same custom object, you may end up with blank fields and missing information. You can adjust your object’s page layout to make sure your data displays correctly. To organize a custom object, you can create Record Types in Salesforce. Record types are like mini page layouts, where certain fields can be hidden from view depending on the chosen layout. For this example, we'll map 3 surveys into the same custom object. These surveys will be called “Customer Service Feedback,” “Trip Feedback,” and “Case Closure.” Build Page Layouts First, you’ll need to create a few page layouts in Salesforce for your custom object. You'll use these page layouts to create record types later. Create the following page layouts: A “primary layout” that includes every field you’ve added. A separate layout for each survey you’re mapping to the object. Each layout should contain only the fields you’re mapping that survey to. In this example, we create 4 page layouts: a primary layout, a Customer Service Feedback layout, a Trip Feedback layout, and a Case Closure layout. Create Record Types After creating your page layouts, create a record type for each page layout. From Setup in Salesforce, go to your object, then select Record Types . Follow this guidance when creating the record types: You’ll need to select an existing record type to create a new one. If you don’t have any, you can use the Master type. Make the record type available for any profile that has access to your survey data. You don’t have to check the Active box yet, but the layouts won’t work until you activate them. On the second page, select the page layout to use for your record type. Repeat the process to create a record type for each page layout you created. Map to a Record Type in SurveyMonkey Finally, map responses from your survey to the appropriate record types in Salesforce. To choose record types in SurveyMonkey: Go to the Salesforce Integration . Connect your account and survey if you haven't already. Create a new mapping . Map all of your responses to the custom object. Under Add more data , map the record type ID to the Record Type ID field as a static value. Select Save object to save your mapping. Repeat for each survey you’re mapping to the custom object. Once you create your mappings, submit a few test survey responses to make sure the responses display correctly in your Record Types.

Any users who are not logging in through the SSO can log in through the SurveyMonkey Apply Log in button. Invited users (recommenders, collaborators) will sign in through native login as there is no guarantee that the SSO-related email address will be used. These types of users should access the site through their invited email or through the SurveyMonkey Apply Log In button. Administrators without an SSO account login can still sign in to the site through the SM Apply login. To access the sign-on page you can also add /admin/ to the end of the site's URL. For example testsite.Apply.com/admin/ Contact Details Contact details for the primary individual implementing the SSO integration on your end should be provided to your Customer Engagement Representative. SAML Integration: Consumption of Apply Metadata It is recommended that your IdP is configured to auto-update SM Apply’s SP metadata. There are two reasons for this: For security purposes; we may release updates to our metadata (certificate updates, encryption values) For stability; metadata updates can introduce periods of time where the SAML connection may fail due to non-matching certificates Changing an SM Apply site’s domain to a custom domain will reflect changes in the SP metadata SAML SSO integration for sites with Custom Domains Sites wishing to use a custom domain should have a domain in place prior to configuring SAML. If the custom domain is not added to the site prior to SAML being set up, issues might occur as Apply’s metadata may reference a URL that is unknown to your IdP.

How to Add New Users,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/add-user/,"How to Add New Users | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Manually Add a User without Sending an Invite Add and Invite a User Import Users in Bulk Help Monitor Manage Users How to Add New Users Apply How to Add New Users Manually Add a User without Sending an Invite Add and Invite a User Import Users in Bulk In order for users to have access to your site, they will either need to register, be invited, or be added to the site by the administrator. This article will outline the three ways that you as an administrator can add a user to your site. Add Users: Overview A user must be added to a site before they will be able to complete any required tasks. The applicant role will support self-registration, however, reviewers and fellow administrators cannot. There are three ways in which you as an administrator can add these users to a site: Manually without Invitation Manually with Invitation Importing in Bulk Applicants can also register for the site themselves. However, Reviewers will need to be added using one of the above options and Recommenders will need to be invited using the Get a Recommendation task. Manually Add a User without Sending an Invite Manually adding users will allow you to add the user’s name, email, and choose the role they will be a part of all at once. The difference between this option and the Invitation Option detailed below is that an email will not automatically be sent to the user. For these cases, sending an email is an extra step that will need to be taken. This can be handy if you wish to complete the process of adding the users but you do not wish to send them an email just yet. To add a user to the site without notifying them: Go to Manage Users . Click on Add User in the top right corner. Enter the First Name , Last Name , and Email Address of the user you wish to add. Select the Role(s) you wish to add the user to. DO NOT select Notify user by email that they have been added . Optional: Enter applicable Role Custom Fields. Click Add User . An email can be sent to invite a user to your site at a later date (after they have been added). For more information, you can refer to How to Send an Invite to an Existing User . Add and Invite a User This step will involve sending an email to the user and allowing them to complete the rest of the registration. In order to Invite a User: Go to Manage Users . Click on Add User in the top right corner. Enter the First Name , Last Name , and Email Address of the user you wish to add. Select the Role(s) you wish to add the user to. Select Notify user by email that they have been added . Optional: Select Include a custom message in the email to send a quick message including the reasoning for inviting them to the site. Optional: Enter applicable Role Custom Fields. Click Add User . If a custom message is not selected then only a generic default message will be sent. The email that is sent to the user reads: Hi there, [Custom Message, if entered] If the link is not clickable, please copy and paste it into your browser's address bar. [Unique link to login to the site] Import Users in Bulk In some cases, you may need to add multiple users to your site at one time. If this is the case you can use the Import Users feature of the site. How to Import Users in Bulk Uploading Duplicate Email Addresses Importing a User to Multiple Roles How to Import Users in Bulk To upload users in bulk: Go to Manage Users . Click on Add User in the top right corner. Click Import Users . Start by deciding the Role that you wish to upload the users to: Applicant, Reviewer, or Recommender. Select Download Template . Each Role will have its own CSV template based on the different information required for that role. If you have custom fields in the site these fields will also be added as columns to the template. Populate the Template with all of the relevant information of the users ensuring that First Name , Last Name , and Email are filled as these are required fields. Once you have saved the file on your computer, select Choose File under Select a populated user list . Choose what you would like to do with Duplicate Email Addresses (refer to the available options below). Optional: Select Notify user by email that they have been added . Optional: Select Include a custom message in the email to send a quick message including the reasoning for inviting them to the site. The same message will be sent to all users in the CSV file. The email sent to the users is: Hi there, [Custom Message, if entered] If the link is not clickable, please copy and paste it into your browser's address bar. [Unique link to login to the site] Uploading Duplicate Email Address If your site already has existing users, you can select how you would like to treat duplicates that may exist in your import. The options you can choose from are: Action Description Skip If there is an email address in the import that already exists in your site, the upload will completely skip over this user, and no further information will be updated. Overwrite Existing Fields In some cases, information may have changed for your users. With this option, if the site recognizes a duplicate it will use the information in the upload to overwrite the information that exists in the site. Update Missing Fields This option means that if the field was not completed previously then it will be updated. This can be useful if you add a new custom field and only wish to update that field for users. Importing a User to Multiple Roles Importing Users is completed one role at a time. If you wish to upload users to multiple roles in the site you will need to repeat the above steps for each of the Roles. As the upload is role specific, choosing to ""Overwrite Existing Fields"" will not have an effect on information for other roles.

Avoiding Scams,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/policy/avoiding-scams/,"Avoiding Scams | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Social Media Paid Studies & Research Scams Job Scams Check Scams Coupon Scams Phishing Surveys Phone Support Scams Help Privacy & Legal Privacy & Data Avoiding Scams SurveyMonkey Avoiding Scams Social Media Paid Studies & Research Scams Job Scams Check Scams Coupon Scams Phishing Surveys Phone Support Scams We’ve become aware of scams such as job offers, fake coupons, or checks that say they’re sponsored by SurveyMonkey. These are not from us—they’re sent by scammers using our name to trick people into sending money or personal info. Our legal team is aware of the illegal use of the SurveyMonkey name and have contacted the appropriate authorities to track down these perpetrators. We urge you to keep an eye out and help report any illegal scams that you come across. Each section below provides you with links to report different types of scams. Contact us if you think you found a scam not mentioned on this page. Social Media Paid Studies & Research Scams I've been offered weekly payment for a research study on Facebook or Instagram. Is this from SurveyMonkey? We’re aware of fraudulent advertisements and phishing emails, posing as SurveyMonkey, that ask people to take part in paid research opportunities—usually for weekly payments. They encourage people to visit websites, take screenshots, or download content to participate in research for payment. This is a scam and isn’t offered by SurveyMonkey. We’re not currently soliciting participation in this type of paid research on social media sites like Facebook or Instagram. Our legal and security teams are aware of these scams and working with authorities. How can I tell if a SurveyMonkey research opportunity is a scam? SurveyMonkey does not directly pay for research using PayPal, Venmo, or CashApp. If an opportunity appears to come from SurveyMonkey and mentions these payment methods, it's a scam. Always check the sender email and domain closely. If you have any doubts, contact us . Job Scams Someone offered me a job to work remotely for SurveyMonkey—is this real? Scammers have posed as SurveyMonkey HR representatives to try and obtain personal or banking information from individuals. These scams aim at getting your banking information by asking you to wire money, or buy electronic equipment online. As a general rule, do not wire money to anyone you don’t know personally! How can I tell if my job offer is a scam? Look at the sender email address domain—if it's from a generic email account, like @gmail.com or @yahoo.com, it's a scam. SurveyMonkey email addresses end in @surveymonkey.com. If someone claims to have found your resume on Craigslist, it is a scam. SurveyMonkey does not recruit from Craigslist. If someone sends you a check claiming to be from SurveyMonkey, it is a scam and the check will bounce. SurveyMonkey does not issue checks to pay our employees. If someone asks you to send them money or buy your own equipment, it is a scam. SurveyMonkey provides our employees with the equipment they need to perform their jobs. Where can I report this scam? Report the scam to the FBI: FBI - Internet Crime Complaint Center If you're located in Canada, report the scam here: Canada — Reporting Fraud If the scammer contacts you with a Gmail email address, report their email account to Google’s abuse team: G oogle Gmail Abuse Check Scams I got a check for a customer evaluation program—is this from SurveyMonkey? No, the check and letter you received are not from SurveyMonkey, but from scammers impersonating the SurveyMonkey name. This is part of a known scam called the Counterfeit Check-Facilitated “Mystery Shopper” scam. Check out the Federal Trade Commission Mystery Shopping Scam Information to learn more about this type of scam. We don't operate any ""mystery shopper"" jobs. The phone number and fax number you've been provided aren't ours, and the people who answer the number, if you choose to call, are not SurveyMonkey employees. We are aware of dozens of people who have been targeted by this scam. If you're a recipient, please contact your local law enforcement officers, the U.S. postal inspector, and your bank to warn them of the fraud. What do the checks look like? Check out these examples of counterfeit checks that have included in these scam packages. As counterfeit checks, they will bounce if you attempt to deposit them. What can I do to stop this scam? Report the scam packages to the U.S. postal inspector: USPS Mail Fraud Complaint Form If the scam package came from Canada, report it here: Canada—Reporting Fraud Coupon Scams Can I use a SurveyMonkey coupon I found online? No, don't try to redeem that coupon. While we allow our users to offer their own coupons, SurveyMonkey itself does not provide coupons to survey respondents or customers. We've seen a number of fake coupons being circulated that claim to be powered by SurveyMonkey or provided in exchange for responding to a SurveyMonkey survey, particularly in the context of fast food restaurants, nutritional supplement discounts, and Visa gift cards. These coupons are not valid and have used the SurveyMonkey name and logo without permission to trick people into thinking they are real. How to identify a fake coupon If a coupon has our logo on it, but claims to be redeemable at another company, it's a scam. Here are some example of scam coupons . They are counterfeits and won't be accepted if you try to use them. Phishing Surveys Phishing is the attempt by scammers to obtain sensitive, personal information (such as your usernames, passwords, credit card details, etc.). If you come across a survey that's phishing for this type of info, don't fill it out. To help you identify what is appropriate survey behavior, check out our Acceptable Uses Policy . Phone Support Scams I found a phone number online for SurveyMonkey customer support. Is this SurveyMonkey? Scammers have posted phone numbers online posing as SurveyMonkey customer support. When called, scammers try to obtain sensitive, personal, or billing information from individuals. SurveyMonkey does not list a support phone number online—you can contact us from our Help Center.

Access the Review (Assignment) Dashboard If your program has launched: From the site dashboard, click on the Title of the Program . Click on the Reviews tab at the top of the page. Download Completed Reviews Go to Manage Reviews . Select the applications you wish to download the reviews for. Click Actions . Click Download Review . This will download the completed reviews for this application in a PDF format. Export Assignments To Export your assignments from the site: Go to Manage Reviews . Select the applications you wish to Export. Click Actions . Click Export . This will export the review details for selected applications in a CSV file based on the Reviewer Columns and Team Columns available on your Review Dashboard. Hide Parts of the Application from the Reviewers Within your review stage settings, you can configure which tasks in the application workflow are to be visible to your reviewers. For example, if you have a form that collects personal information about the applicant, but you wish it to be a blind review, you can choose to hide that form. Information can only be hidden from reviewers at the Task level. You can't hide questions within a form from reviewers. Go to your Workflow. Access the Review Stage. Go to the Visibility tab. Click to Choose Application Task . Click Select Tasks . Select only the tasks that should be visible. Click Done . Save the stage. For more information on Stage Visibility, you can refer to Advanced Review Stage Visibility and Simple Review Stage Visibility . Share Review Scores/Comments Between Reviewers By default, a reviewer will only be able to see their own reviews and scores. However, you may wish for reviewers to see each other's reviews, for example seeing reviews from previous review stages. Go to your Workflow. Access the Review Stage. Go to the Visibility tab. Go to the section for Reviewer and Review data visible to Reviewers . Enable Reviews from other reviewers. This will allow reviewers in the same stage to see the reviews if they are assigned to the same application. Optional: Select from the additional settings that appear to manage which reviewers can share reviews. Save the stage. Clear Reviews There may be certain situations where reviews are completed in error due to incorrectly distributed assignments or in the case where a reviewer can no longer participate in a review process. Why Clear a Review? The purpose of clearing a review is to ensure all reporting data is relevant and that only applicable reviews are considered when the final decision of an application is made. Clearing a review does not remove the review assignment from a reviewer or team. Instead, this action will clear all review task progress the user or team has made for a given application. It is applied at the stage level so clearing a review of reviewers or teams in one stage will not affect other reviews completed for an application in other review stages within a program. How to Clear Reviews To clear the review of an individual application: From Manage Reviews, choose the review stage where the review was completed. Select the Reviewers or Teams tab where the application is assigned. Select the More Options icon for the application. Select Clear Review . To clear the reviews of multiple applications from a single reviewer or review team: From Manage Reviews, choose the review stage where the review was completed. Select the Reviewers or Teams tab where the application is assigned. Select the applications to clear reviews from. Select Actions . Click Clear Review . Assignments Aren't Appearing to the Reviewer There are a few reasons that applications may not appear or be reviewable to reviewers in their site, including: They have filters applied. The applications aren't in the review stage. The assignments weren't completed to connect the reviewer to the application. The date is before the review start date or after the close date of the review stage. For more information on this issue, you can refer to our article on Troubleshooting Reviewer Issues , that walks through a few common questions a reviewer may have and how to address them. Applications Aren't Being Unassigned from the Reviewer If you are looking to unassign an application from a reviewer, and upon performing the unassignment, the application remains it may be because the reviewer is a member of a team that the application is assigned to. If the application is assigned at the team level and the reviewer is a member of that team, then you won't be able to unassign the application from the one reviewer. In this case, the reviewer would need to be removed from the team. Alternatively, depending on the reason for unassigning the application, you could also mark the application as a Conflict of Interest for the reviewer. This would remove the application from the reviewers' view, and flag it as a conflict of interest. Reviewers Can't See Applications After Submitting the Review If this is the case, it is likely that you have an automated process set up so that when the reviewer completes the review the application is moved onto the next stage . Once an application is moved out of the reviewer stage, it will no longer be visible to the reviewer. If you wish to allow the reviewers to continue to see the applications in their screen after completing the review, there are two options: Deactivate the automation that moves the applications forward, and then move them manually when you are ready. Set a deferral on the automation , so that when the reviewer completes the review the application will remain in their screen for a designated amount of time before it's automatically moved forward.

Before you complete a payment when signing up, upgrading, creating a team, or making a one-time purchase in your account, we make sure to clearly display the billing currency you'll be charged in right above the Confirm or Pay button. Changing Your Currency Your billing currency depends on your billing country. Your billing country needs to match the country where your payment method is located—you can't directly edit your billing currency since it's tied to your payment method. To edit your billing country: If you're signing up for a new account, you'll select your billing country on the checkout page. If you have an existing account, you can edit your billing country in the Payment Information section of the Billing Details tab. In some situations, you might not be able to edit your billing country when updating your payment method. If you run into this issue and see an error message, you can contact us for more info. TIP! If you pay for SurveyMonkey through the SurveyMonkey iOS app, billing is managed by Apple instead of SurveyMonkey. To change your billing currency, you'll need to update your Apple ID payment method. Currency Conversion The amount you're being charged in your local currency might not convert to our exact pricing in USD or in another market—this means if you use the current exchange rate to convert your local currency to USD, it might not match. Since SurveyMonkey is available all over the globe, our pricing can differ from country to country. To determine pricing in each market, we take currency fluctuation into account, as well as the price for similar services in a given market. We make sure to be as transparent as possible by showing you the exact amount you’ll be charged by SurveyMonkey and in what currency before you submit your payment. International Transaction Fees Your card issuer or bank may add a currency conversion or foreign transaction fee to your payment. If you have a larger than expected charge, please contact your provider for information on what rates and fees may apply, as these are not controlled by or known to SurveyMonkey. You may also be seeing a pre-authorization . Supported Currencies When you sign up, upgrade, create a team, or make a one-time purchase in your account, you'll be charged in the local currency of your billing country, if that currency is supported at the time of your purchase. Your plan subscription will renew at the billing currency you were charged previously, unless you edit your payment method and associated billing currency before renewal. If your billing country is not listed, the local currency for your billing country is not supported—see info on Unsupported Currencies .

One-time Audience purchases are not currently available to customers in Brazil paying with BRL. Unsupported Currencies If your billing country is not supported at the time of your purchase, you'll be charged in USD. If your payment method is located in a European country whose currency is not supported, your billing currency may be EUR and not USD. This includes, but may not be limited to, Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine. If you were charged in USD or EUR, your plan subscription will also renew in USD or EUR, even if your local currency has become supportable since your original payment. There are a couple situations where you can switch to your local billing currency for your next renewal, if it's now a supported currency: If you're currently being billed in USD or EUR but your local billing currency is now supported, you can contact us to switch to your local billing currency for your next renewal. If you create a team , you'll be charged for additional users in your local currency if it's supported at the time you create the team (if this is the case, you'll see the price per user listed in the local currency in your account), and your plan subscription will be renewed in that local currency instead of USD or EUR at your next renewal date.

Create Mappings In SurveyMonkey, set up mappings to update an existing record when a response is submitted. Map the Response Created attribute from SurveyMonkey to the Sent Date field you created in Salesforce. At the Deployment Options , create a Weblink Collector.

To help keep your bounce and abuse rates low, read our Acceptable Uses Policy so you understand what is and is not permitted. Messages Pending Approval Occasionally, a message you try to send may be flagged for review and marked as Pending Approval . After reviewing, we'll release messages that comply with our Acceptable Uses Policy , or we'll contact you to notify you of any issues. Messages may be marked for review for a few reasons: The message was auto-flagged as spam by our system. Most people don't realize that emails they send can be considered as spam by email clients or by recipients, so we created some great guidelines for avoiding spam filters . The opt out link was not clearly labeled or was hidden in the message. Cleaning Your Email List If you exceed bounce rates or abuse rates, we may suspend your mailing privileges within SurveyMonkey. You will need to clean your email lists in order to reactivate your mailing privileges. It's your responsibility to clean your email lists outside of SurveyMonkey before using them on the site. It's not permitted to use SurveyMonkey as a method of cleaning your email lists. Bounced Emails : We monitor hard bounces. A hard bounce is an email message that was returned to the sender and is permanently undeliverable. This may be due to an invalid email address or a mail server blocking the SurveyMonkey domain. You can view bounced recipients at any time within an Email Invitation. Abuse Complaints : Email providers send us the number of recipients who manually mark your email invitations sent via SurveyMonkey as spam. The percentage of your messages that were marked as spam contribute to your abuse rate. This percentage does not include bounces or people who opt-out via the remove link inside the message. You cannot track abuse rates within SurveyMonkey. TIP! If you need to send a survey right away, create a Web Link and distribute the survey through your own email client.

For example, get 80% of your completed responses from female respondents and 20% from male respondents. To use custom balancing: Create a Targeted Audience collector. Under Basic Demographics, click Age or Gender . Choose the Custom option. Any previously selected age or gender criteria is removed so you can use the custom balancing tool. For Gender , use the slider scale to pick the percentage of responses you want from males and females. For Age , click Edit and enter the minimum and maximum age range for each group you're looking to survey. You can target 2–8 different age groups. Next enter the percentage of complete responses you want from each group (the percentages must total 100%). Each age range should be 5 years or more (18–23 works, but 18–21 doesn't), and age groups can't overlap (you can't have both 18-30 and 25-35 as age groups). Click Save once you're done. Take a look at your Project Details on the right side of the page to review your custom balancing selections and the additional cost per response. TIP! Custom balancing restricts the pool of available people to take your survey, so you may have to buy a larger number of completed responses than you need. The exact number is variable and depends on: the number of age group, the size of each age group, the percentage of responses for each age group, and any custom gender balancing. Completed Responses Due to the nature of the system, the variability of response rates, and natural margin of error, we can't guarantee that you'll get the exact number of completed responses that you specified per gender and age. There's a fault tolerance of ±5 responses per gender group and age group. Read more about completed responses . Using Both Age and Gender Balancing You can use both custom age and gender balancing at the same time. When you do that, we combine the percentage of both gender and age balancing to determine the distribution of responses from each gender against each age group. Let's say you're buying 500 completed responses and choose the following custom gender and age balancing settings: Gender : Female 75%, Male 25% Age : 18–29: 30%, When you do that, we combine the percentage of both gender and age balancing to determine the number of completed responses your project will receive: 70% With these custom gender and age balancing options, the system calculates how many responses each gender + age group will get like this: Completed Responses (500) * Female Responses (75%) * 18-29 Age Group (30%) = 113 responses Completed Responses (500) * Female Responses (75%) * 30–39 Age Group (70%) = 263 responses Completed Responses (500) * Male Responses (25%) * 18-29 Age Group (30%) = 38 responses Completed Responses (500) * Male Responses (25%) * 30–39 Age Group (70%) = 88 responses Related Articles SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings Feature Importance (MaxDiff) Using SurveyMonkey for Market Research English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"
Accepting Payments with Stripe,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/stripe/,"Accepting Payments with Stripe | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Connecting to Stripe Creating Your Form Form Responses & Payment Transactions Making a Payment Help Creating Surveys Question Settings Accepting Payments with Stripe SurveyMonkey Accepting Payments with Stripe Connecting to Stripe Creating Your Form Form Responses & Payment Transactions Making a Payment PAID FEATURE: Accepting payments via Stripe is only available on some paid plans—see what's on your plan . If you're on an Enterprise team with data stored in our Canadian Data Center, this feature isn't available. You can see if this applies to you by checking your Account Details . Add a payment page to the end of your form or survey and accept payments through Stripe . You can either assign prices to a single question, or charge a fixed price for your entire form. Connecting to Stripe Stripe is a third-party payment processor that lets you securely accept and manage payments online. You'll need to connect a Stripe account to accept payments in SurveyMonkey. Only the form owner can connect their stripe account. You can't connect a Stripe account to forms that are shared with you. To connect to Stripe: Go to My Account in SurveyMonkey. In the Linked Accounts section, find Stripe. Sign in to an existing Stripe account, or create a new Stripe account . Stripe is free and easy to set up, but if you have any issues connecting your account you can reach out to the friendly Stripe support team. Creating Your Form Adding a Payment Page Payment pages come at the end of your form. This means people need to complete your form in order to see it. For a quick payment experience, try to make a short and simple form. To add a payment page to your form: Go to the Design Survey section. On the left side of the page, open the Options menu. Select Payment . Select Stripe . Assigning Prices You can set a fixed price so all respondents are charged the same amount, assign prices to a single question in your form, or let people pay within a range. Prices must be a whole number between $1 and $10,000 in most accepted currencies . Feel free to make changes to your prices as you need—changes that you make to your form go live as soon as you edit your form design. Expand | Collapse Charging a Fixed Price Use this option if you want everyone who completes your form to pay the same amount. This is great if you're selling tickets to an event or selling a single product. To charge a fixed price: Add a payment page to your form. Select Charge a Fixed Price . Enter a Description to confirm what people are buying. Enter a Price and choose a Currency . Click Save . Assigning Different Prices Use this option to let people decide between multiple items or prices. To assign different prices: Add a payment page to your form. Select Assign prices to an existing question . Choose an existing question from your form in the dropdown menu. You can assign prices to Multiple Choice, Dropdown, and Image Choice questions. Select a Currency and assign a Price to each answer option. Click Save . Using a Sliding Scale Use this option to set a minimum and maximum amount so people can pay what they want. To use a sliding scale: Add a payment page to your form. Choose an existing question from your form in the dropdown menu. You can set a sliding scale on a Text Box or Slider question, or set a minimum and maximum amount on a Multiple Choice question if you add an ""Other"" option and display it as an answer choice. Select a currency and assign a minimum and maximum payment amount. Click Save . TIP! If you have a limited amount of tickets or items that you want to accept payment for, you can add a quota to your form. Once the quota has been met, respondetns won't see the payment page. Currency Options People taking your form have plenty of options to pay—Stripe supports over 135 currencies and accepts major credit cards. Form Responses & Payment Transactions Collecting Responses After you design your form, create a collector to send it out and start accepting payments. Web Links are the easiest way to get started, and Email Invitations are great if you have an email list to send your form to. You can send a form with a payment page using any collector type —except for Audience, Mobile SDK, Facebook Messenger and Kiosk Survey. After a respondent submits a payment, they won't be able to return to the form even when Response Editing is on. Viewing Transactions When someone submits a payment through your form, Stripe collects all of the details from the payment page, which means SurveyMonkey never saves or stores any credit card numbers. You can go to the Analyze Results section of your form to see a limited record of your transactions. You'll find them at the very bottom of your form results. The transaction record shows: Stripe's transaction ID number The amount paid The date and time The item description The respondent's first and last name The transaction status This is only a snapshot of each payment taken at the time the form is completed. To view real-time purchase totals, make refunds, and transfer funds to your bank account, log in to Stripe . Turning Off Payments You can stop accepting payments at any time by deleting the payment page from your form or by closing your form . Deleting a payment page from your form will also delete any transaction records from previous payments in the Analyze Results section. You'll always be able to see your complete transaction record in your Stripe account. If you disconnect your Stripe account in My Account , you won't be able to collect any additional payments from forms with a payment page. Making a Payment When someone submits a payment through your form, they'll receive an email from Stripe confirming their transaction. Transactions appear on their credit or debit card statements with the name of your form. SurveyMonkey's platform allows you to integrate with third-party payment processors. Some of these payment processors may require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) . People in Europe who submit payment through your form may need to provide additional authentication. It's not possible to disable this authentication when payment processors require it. If someone runs into issues making payment, they can reach out to Stripe or their card issuer for help.

Copy a Previous Message If you don't want to write your message from scratch, you can copy any message that was previously sent or saved as a draft. You're able to make additional edits to your message after copying a previous message. To copy a previous message: Create a new Invitation, Reminder, or Thank You message. Click Copy a previous message . Browse the messages you previously used in any Email Invitation collector in your account. Click a subject line to see the contents of the message. When you find the message you want to copy, hover over the message and click Copy Message . Why don't I see my previous message? When sending Invitation or Thank You messages, you only see previous messages of the same type as the message you're sending. For example, if you're sending an Invitation message, you only see previous Invitation messages. When sending a Reminder message, you can also see previous Invitation messages. Viewing Sent Messages You can view sent messages from your Message History. Troubleshooting Issues Expand | Collapse Why does the email look different than what I see in SurveyMonkey? Your emails should look good in most modern email clients. However, email clients can display HTML messages differently, which could cause some variation in your HTML Template or Custom HTML messages, especially in older email clients. For example, fonts, font sizes, or layout may look different in Gmail than they do in Outlook. This isn't something we can fix on our end—it depends on the particular email client. To optimize the email, you can tell contacts to: Enable HTML viewing Allow images to be displayed I don't see the Begin Survey button If you or your contacts use Lotus Notes, the Begin Survey button won't display if you chose the HTML Template messaging format. Unfortunately, this isn't something we can fix on our end—Lotus Notes isn't properly rendering the HTML. But, there are a couple workarounds you can try: Workaround 1 Use the Plain Text message format to send your invitation instead. This will remove any text formatting and display the full survey URL in the email. Workaround 2 Use the Custom HTML message format to send your invitation. Replace the button code that Lotus Notes can't render with code that hyperlinks text instead. To replace the button code: Switch your message format to Custom HTML. In the HTML, find the following code: <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" align=""center"" style=""background:#4B4A3C; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #BBBBBB; color:#FFFFFF; font-size:14px; letter-spacing: 1px; text-shadow: -1px -1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); padding: 10px 18px;""> <tr> <td align=""center"" valign=""center""> <a href=""[SurveyLink]"" target=""_blank"" style=""color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration:none;"">Begin Survey</a> </td> </tr> </table> 3.

SAML: How to Prepare,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/saml-how-to/,"SAML: How to Prepare | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article SAML: Overview User who signs in Identity Provider (IdP) Service Provider (SP) SSO Protocol The ""WHAT"" The ""WHO"" The ""HOW"" Help Advanced Features SAML: How to Prepare Apply SAML: How to Prepare SAML: Overview User who signs in Identity Provider (IdP) Service Provider (SP) SSO Protocol The ""WHAT"" The ""WHO"" The ""HOW"" SAML: Overview Single Sign-On (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. In the context of SurveyMonkey Apply, SSO implementation allows clients to leverage their existing user authentication framework to permit and provision access to an SM Apply site. By the end of this document, you will know how to set up such an integration using SAML protocol. Entities Involved There are 4 key entities to an SSO integration: User who signs in Identity Provider (IdP) Service Provider (SP) SSO Protocol User who signs in Applicants The user is an applicant who is trying to login and access SM Apply. To improve the user experience of external users who may be invited to your site (co-applicants, recommenders), your SAML integration will not be utilized. Doing so will help prevent unforeseen challenges such as your users not being invited with an email address matching your IdP's records. Identity Provider (IdP) The Identity Provider is an instance of an SSO issuing server that is responsible for housing and validating a user’s account credentials as well as provisioning access. It has a few main purposes: Provides unique identifiers (UID) for users looking to interact with a system or software. Emits other user account information (attributes), as allowed by the the third party, along with any other account metadata necessary for the integration to SM Apply. Provisions user account access to SM Apply. Establishes a “trust” with Apply. Service Provider (SP) The Service Provider is the software or system, in this case SM Apply, establishing a trust relationship with an IdP and requesting user account provisioning from that IdP. It is also responsible for consuming information (attributes/metadata) that may be passed from the IdP. SSO Protocol The protocol is what facilitates the integration between the IdP and SP. It defines the handshake (sequence of events/data passing) for the integration. The ""WHAT"" What SSO provider will you be using? [SAML, CAS, or OAuth] The ""WHO"" Which user groups need to sign in via SSO? [Applicants] By default, users are added to the Applicant group in SM Apply External users (for example, collaborators or recommenders) may bypass SSO at this time. This is to reduce friction and improve the user experience of external users. The ""HOW"" How are users uniquely identified? [i.e. email, student number, employee ID, etc.] How will users enter Apply? [SP-initiated SSO or IdP-initiated SSO] IdP-initiated SSO is only available using SAML protocol What attributes need to be passed to Apply? [First name, Last name, email, etc.] Depending on the protocol used, required vs. optional attribute limitations may exist SAML: Can your IdP automatically consume Apply’s XML metadata? SSO works by creating an integration between an IdP and Apply via the SSO protocol. The handshake passes along key user information, including the UID. The key role of the IdP is to verify that a user’s information is known and that correct account details have been provided. Once Apply has received the verification, the user is then able to access Apply. A new Apply account will be created for a user if one does not already exist. If an account already exists for this user, Apply will match the incoming user to the pre-existing account using the email address received from the IdP. SSO can be initiated in two ways: SP-initiated and/or IdP-initiated. SAML: Do my assertions and responses need to be signed? To successfully log users in with SAML, SMA requires that all instances are sending signed assertions and responses from your organization’s SSO portal into Apply. This configuration must be done within your own settings and is not something our Support or Engineering teams are able to modify on your behalf. SP-initiated “Service provider initiated” SSO is when a user comes first to the SM Apply site, clicks the SSO sign-in button and inputs their username and password. This then starts the authentication process with SM Apply sending out a call for authentication to the IdP. IdP-initiated “Identity provider initiated” SSO begins when a user signs into your main hub, not SM Apply. The user clicks an option on the company’s page that brings them into Apply. In this case the IdP is initiating the sign-on to SM Apply. Due to the technical nature of implementing an SSO Integration, and the number of authentication services, SM Apply recommends there to be a technical expert experienced with SAML to be facilitating the configuration aspects on the client end.

How to Remove a Label from an Application,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/remove-app-label/,"How to Remove a Label from an Application | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Manually Remove a Label How to Remove a Label Using an Automation Help Monitor Manage Applications How to Remove a Label from an Application Apply How to Remove a Label from an Application How to Manually Remove a Label How to Remove a Label Using an Automation When a label has been incorrectly applied or the eligibility for a label changes, the label can be removed manually or by an automation. This article covers how to remove a label from an application. How to Manually Remove a Label This option is useful in select cases where a label has been incorrectly applied. To remove a label from an individual application manually: Go to the Manage Applications page. Select an application. Select the Labels drop-down. Select the label(s) to remove from the application. Select Done . To remove a label from multiple applications: Go to the Manage Applications page. Select all applications to apply the label to. Select the Labels drop-down. Select the labels(s) to removing from the application. Select Done . How to Remove a Label Using an Automation Remove label from application Remove all labels from application Remove label from application Depending on your own use case you may wish to automatically remove a single label from an application. For example, if an application is able to have more than one label on the application however if two or more labels are mutually exclusive. Example: the application has labels on it for the year however the application has the option of selecting the semester they are applying for within the form. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Task A Task has been Edited after Completion Application Form CONDITIONS Application Form What semester are you applying for? is exactly Winter DO Action source Source Application Remove a Label from the Application Label: Fall Action source Source Application Add a Label to the Application Label: Winter You would then need to duplicate this automation so that you would have one to apply the Fall label. This setup will ensure that if the applicant changes their response the Fall label will be removed and the Winter label will be applied. We also use this, instead of the Remove all labels from application action to ensure that any additional labels, such as the year, are not removed. Remove all labels from application You can use automations to remove all labels previously applied to an application. To do so, the DO statement section of your automation should include the Remove all labels from application statement. This will remove all active labels from the application and cannot be limited to remove specific labels. A common use case for this action is when an application form can be edited by the application and labels are applied based on response collected in the form. An automation can help ensure the correct labels are removed/added to the application in the case where an applicant changes their response. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Task A Task has been Edited after Completion Application Form CONDITIONS Not required for this scenario. DO Action source Source Application Remove All Labels from the Application Action source Source Application Add a Label to the Application Label: New label to be applied Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Log in Sign up free Our Marketo integration lets you sync your SurveyMonkey response data with your leads in Marketo. You can use it to create or update leads in Marketo from contact information collected in SurveyMonkey, attach survey response data from SurveyMonkey to existing leads in Marketo, and trigger email campaigns based on certain response conditions. Get the integration! The Marketo integration is available as an add-on at an additional cost. Contact sales » Survey Requirements When you build your survey think about how it should map to your Marketo fields. For example: If you're mapping to a date field in Marketo, make sure that your survey includes a Date/Time question. If you want a survey to create new leads, make sure your survey includes questions like Name , Email address , Phone , or Address . Connecting a Survey to Marketo Once your survey and Marketo account are ready, follow these steps to link a survey to Marketo: Log in to SurveyMonkey. Click the grid icon in the top right corner and select Integrations & Plug-Ins . Click Marketo. Click Connect Survey . Choose your survey from the dropdown menu. Select a Mapping Action and review its options. If you're updating leads, create your Query Mappings . If you're using Marketo to send out your campaign, keep the SurveyMonkey Field Marketo Lead Id mapped to the Marketo Lead Field Id . If you're distributing the survey in another way, read more about Query Mappings . Select your Field Mapping , or how the response fields from your survey should map to each Marketo lead. Select or create a collector for the integration to use and click Save . Copy and paste the survey URL into your Marketo email or landing page template. Existing survey responses that were collected before connecting with Marketo will not populate in Marketo. Mapping Actions Mapping Action Description Create a New Lead Creates a new lead in Marketo for each survey response. This option doesn't look to see if the lead exists, it just creates a new one each time. Update an Existing Lead Uses your query mapping to find existing leads. If a lead exist, it's updated. If it doesn't exist, it'll add an entry to your Error Log. Update or Create Lead Uses your query mapping to find existing leads. If a lead exists, it's updated. If it doesn't exist, a new lead is created. Options Options Description Overwrite record fields that have existing values Replaces the values in existing Marketo fields with whatever is entered into your survey unless the field is blocked in Marketo. If not selected, only empty lead fields will be updated. We recommend only using this option if all fields you're mapping come from required questions in SurveyMonkey. Sync response metadata using a 'SurveyMonkey Event' activity Adds SurveyMonkey Event as a custom activity in your lead's Activity Log in Marketo. This custom activity includes: Survey Name, Survey ID, Event Type, Event Value, Event Time, and Event Duration. Sync all question responses using 'SurveyMonkey Answer' activities Adds SurveyMonkey Answer as a custom activity in your lead's Activity Log in Marketo for each question on your survey that the respondent answers. This custom activity includes: Survey Name, Survey ID, Question Name, Question ID, Question Answer, Question Answer Number Value, Column Weight, Column Label, Row Label. TIP! SurveyMonkey's custom activities let you create Smart Lists in Marketo to segment leads based on how they answered questions in your survey. When you create a Smart List, use the Survey Name, Question Name, and Question Response values from the Survey Answer activity to build your filter. For example, create a Smart List that filters for leads that answered a 9 or 10 to the Net Promoter Score question—making them a Promoter of your brand. Query Mappings SurveyMonkey uses your Query Mapping criteria to determine which lead to update. If you're using Marketo to send out your survey, leave the SurveyMonkey Field Marketo Lead Id mapped to the Marketo Lead Field Id . If you're distributing your survey in another way, you'll need to map a survey field to another field in Marketo that'll let the integration look up your leads by that field to figure out which one to update. For example, if you want to use an email address, select the SurveyMonkey question that collects an email address and map it to the Marketo field that stores it. Whatever you choose should be unique, if you have multiple leads with the same email address, you may want to map a second value to look leads up by, like, name. This way you can create a unique combination. Add more mappings to your lookup by clicking Add Field Mapping . If the integration comes up with more than one lead that matches your Query Mapping criteria, it'll log it in your Error Log. Field Mapping The Field Mappings table lets you map how the integration syncs the answers from your survey to your leads in Marketo. The Hidden Mappings table lets you map custom values to Marketo fields to be passed with each response—for example send a value describing or coding your survey's audience. When mapping fields remember that: The fields must match in data type, so a date field in Marketo should match a Date/Time question in SurveyMonkey and an email field in Marketo should match a question asking for an email address in SurveyMonkey. If you've turned on the option to overwrite existing data, a respondent leaving a mapped question blank could result in data loss. You can avoid this by making mapped questions required or setting a default value for the mapping. You can make a question required directly from the mapping page by clicking the yellow triangle icon next to the mapping. Any field you've set to be blocked in Marketo can't be overwritten, even if you've turned on the overwrite existing data option. Not all survey questions need to be mapped to a lead field. The responses to unmapped questions are available in Analyze and, if you're using the sync SurveyMonkey Answers option, in your lead's Action Log in Marketo. When you map to a boolean field in Marketo, it's set to True if any answer is selected or entered—you won't be able to determine what the answer is. Only map to a boolean field if you just want to capture if a particular optional question was answered or not. TIP! To create and map a Yes/No question, add a multiple choice question to your Survey, label your answer options Yes and No, and map these options to text fields in Marketo. To set a default value to pass if a question isn't answered: Click the Set default value icon (which looks like a pencil and paper) to the right of the mapped value you want to set a default for. Enter your desired value into the Default Value box. Managing Connected Surveys You can view and manage your connected surveys from the main page of the integration where they're listed in a table. TIP! Use the Audit Log to jump directly to a lead in Marketo by clicking Lead Id or jump directly to the response in Analyze by clicking Respondent Id . Column Description Name The name of the survey. Created The date you first connected the survey to Marketo. Status Active : The survey is actively syncing with the Marketo object. Paused : New responses won't sync with Marketo. Created Leads The number of new leads that have been created based on a new survey response. Updated Leads The number of existing leads that have been updated based on a new survey response. Actions View Link : Get the survey link you need to copy and paste into your Marketo email or landing page template. Edit : Edit the syncing options and mapping you configured when you connected the survey to Marketo. Pause/Restart : Pause or restart syncing between the survey and the Marketo object. Any new survey responses collected while the project is paused won't update or create leads in Marketo. Delete : Disconnects the survey from the Marketo object and removes it from the list. To reconnect them, you'll need to create the project again. View Audit Log : View a log of responses that have been transferred to Marketo. View Error Log : View a log of any sync errors that have occurred. This option only shows up if there are sync errors.

If you extend the duration, your share link will remain the same. If you close the current review session and open a new one, a brand new share link will be generated. This allows you to stop access to an old link (if it falls into the wrong hands) and easily restart your review session with a new link. Renew an Expired Review Session Link If a link expires, ask the person who originally shared the link with you to extend the share session. Review Session Permissions When a review session is opened, different user types will have varying levels of automatic permissions: Guest: Has view-only access and can comment on the survey.

This option is available when you select the Share icon from or create a survey from scratch. Depending on how your Primary Admin set up sharing for your team, you may not be able to edit this setting. Resharing surveys If a survey owner allows resharing, any Enterprise user or Team Full Access seat can share a survey that was previously shared with them. Analyst seats and people outside the team can't reshare. Resharing stays active when a survey is transferred, but not when a survey is copied. Resharing for survey owners To allow resharing, select Allow people on your team to reshare with other people when you're sharing a single survey. Some people on Enterprise plans won’t see this option if their Primary Admin has it turned off. The resharing option is specific to each survey, so you can choose which surveys you want to allow others to reshare. When turned on, surveys can be reshared with anyone. If you uncheck the Resharing option, it restricts future resharing of that survey. Any surveys reshared before you turned off resharing remain shared.

You'll see a list of each section of the survey and your current level of access. Next to the section you want more access to, select Request Access . The survey owner will get an email about the request and can choose to change your access levels. There's no way to request a specific level of access—it's up to the survey owner to decide what level of access they give you. Your seat may also limit the level of access you can have to a specific section of a survey.

You can then view and take action on your responses. Forms and surveys are both created the same way, so you can use this help center for guidance while creating, sending, and analyzing your forms. Creating a Form To create a new form, click Create Survey from the header menu in your account and choose from the options. Expand | Collapse Start from scratch Get started with a blank page. You can add questions by using the tools in the left sidebar to build your form. If you have questions ready to go and want to copy and paste them to your form, select My questions are already written . Copy a past form You can create a copy of a form that's in your account. This way you don't have to start from scratch or change past ones that have already collected responses. The form questions, logic, theme, and other design settings are carried over to the copy, but you'll need to create a new collector to send your form. TIP! Click the Favorite icon to add the form to your favorites so it’s easier to find the ones you use most often. Start from a template Get a head start by using a template designed by our team of experts. Use the dropdown menu to browse templates by type to find the right survey for you. If you're on a team, you can also browse your team templates . Click on any template to learn more about it and preview the questions. You’re able to customize questions and answer choices so it's relevant to your goals. For example, you can add the specific product or company name you're looking for feedback on. You may also want to add new questions or delete questions that aren't useful to you. When you're working on your form, use the sidebar to add your own questions or choose pre-written questions from our Question Bank . You can apply question settings to further customize too. If you have a long form, break it up into multiple pages . Pages help you organize your form into sections, which makes it easier for people to take. Plus, every time they go to the next page, their previous responses are saved. After your questions and pages are set up, it's a good time to apply logic to the form. Logic can help you get better data by creating a more personalized experience for respondents. After your questions and logic are in place, you can focus on fine-tuning the look and feel of your form with our design and display options . Some customization options are only available on certain paid plans . Add a payment page to your form to collect payments for classes, application or membership fees, event registrations, and more. Previewing Your Form It’s always a good idea to preview your form before sending it to respondents, so you can catch any mistakes or logic issues . If you’re collaborating, you can invite others to give feedback on your form by sharing the preview link or sending an invite to comment. Embedding or Sending Your Form Once your form is ready, click Collect Responses and create a collector so people can complete it. There are various ways you can get your form out there to collect responses. For example, you can embed your form or show a pop-up invitation to your form on your website. Or, you could create a URL or QR code linking to your form so you can send or post it anywhere you want. Reviewing Responses in Analyze When you view your results in the Analyze Results section, you can view all responses at a glance in our Individual Responses table view . Or, view Question Summaries to view summaries of each survey question. You’re able to export your responses or even import your responses to Google Sheets .

On the integration page, click on the More Options icon at the top of the Integration. Click Sync with Salesforce Manual Syncs will update existing records in SF - this is helpful for retroactive fixes/updating information such as Reviewer scores. There are no limits on the number of manual syncs you can do. However, keep in mind the API calls that could be made with this. Deactivate all actions you do not want to run when doing a manual sync to help limit the API calls as much as possible. Multi-Program Sites WARNING! We do not recommend to use manual syncs when you have multiple programs, as a manual sync is not program specific. All actions will sync for all applications. The below information is applicable if you only have one program within your SM Apply site. Sometimes the Salesforce integration isn’t added to the Apply site until after some Apply records/data have already been created. If this is the case, you can perform a manual sync that will apply all active Salesforce actions to all the existing objects in the system. This includes automations that are active. For example, if you have Salesforce actions that will map an Application owner’s name to a Salesforce Lead name, any existing applications will sync to new Lead objects in Salesforce.

We’ve outlined below how our AI and machine learning features process your data when you use them. Feature Description AI features to create a survey ( Build with AI and importing surveys with AI ) This setting turns on features that help you build and improve your survey. These features allow SurveyMonkey customers to create surveys assisted by generative AI, utilizing the Azure OpenAI or OpenAI service. To provide survey creation features, your survey prompts and an encrypted user ID are sent to the Azure OpenAI or OpenAI Service. These third party providers do not use this data to train their models. Sentiment Analysis Sentiment Analysis uses our proprietary machine learning models to classify text responses as positive, negative or neutral. Response Quality Response Quality uses our proprietary machine learning models to scan your survey data and flag low-quality responses. Analyze with AI Analyze with AI uses the Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI to deliver insights. When you use Analyze with AI, your survey data, including survey title, survey questions, and answer options are sent to the Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI to generate insights about your survey. Any questions or prompts you enter are shared with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. Individual survey responses and metadata submitted to your survey aren’t shared with the Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI, and your content isn’t used to train these third party providers’ models. Thematic Analysis SurveyMonkey's Thematic Analysis feature uses a self-hosted Anthropic model in a secure data environment to analyze and group your responses. The feature uses your question text, response text, and response ID. Your survey data remains private and secure. Anthropic does not have access to your data and your data is not used to train their AI models. We also mask common data types, like phone numbers and social security numbers, to reduce exposure of potentially sensitive data.

How to Apply a Custom (Vanity) URL,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/features/custom-url/,"How to Apply a Custom (Vanity) URL | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Why Use a Vanity URL Applying Your Vanity URL Applying Your Vanity URL in SM Apply Help Features and Settings General Settings How to Apply a Custom (Vanity) URL Apply How to Apply a Custom (Vanity) URL Why Use a Vanity URL Applying Your Vanity URL Applying Your Vanity URL in SM Apply A vanity URL is a custom URL that redirects to the SurveyMonkey Apply web address of your site. This article covers how to apply a vanity URL to an SM Apply site to make your site URL easy to remember and share. Adding a Custom URL is only available for Enterprise clients. Why Use a Vanity URL A vanity URL acts as a mask and will remove the smapply domain from your sites web address. Preferably a vanity URL is short, easy to remember, and allows you to keep your brand consistent. A vanity URL must be purchased from a domain registrar. In most cases, you will want to contact your IT department to handle the configuration required for associating your vanity URL to your domain name as updates to DNS settings are required. Applying Your Vanity URL Using a vanity URL will require some changes to your DNS settings in order for your browser to match the new URL with your SM Apply site. This process will vary depending on the domain registrar you are using, but most registrars will have extensive documentation on their unique process. Generally, these steps consist of: Choosing a vanity URL name. Accessing the DNS settings of your domain. Adding a CNAME that points to smapply.io. The DNS configuration must have a CNAME pointing to your SM Apply site URL (example: <yoursite>. smapply.io ) for the domain to direct your users successfully. Please note that most registrars do not allow CNAME records on the root domain, so you will need to use a subdomain in order to configure this correctly. The use of a root domain with an apex record pointing to an Apply IP address is not supported and will result in users being unable to access your site when IP address changes occur. WARNING! It can take up to 48 hours for these changes to propagate which will force you to wait before adding your vanity URL to SM Apply. Applying Your Vanity URL in SM Apply In your site go to Settings Click on General Under the Site Details section, click the Add Custom Domain button. Enter your custom domain Select Save If the CNAME has not been added successfully or has not yet been recognized the error message “your domain is not a valid domain” will be displayed after selecting save. Once you have added your custom domain you will have the ability to add additional custom domains, if necessary.

Common formats are: ""The Action: Brief Summary of the Automation"" OR ""Activation -> Action"" For example, if an automation is used to move an application to another review stage based on a response in a ranking form, the automation could be named: ""Move: Approved Application to Follow-Up Review"" OR ""Upon Approval - > Move to Follow-Up Review Stage"" This title allows any administrator within the site to search and modify the automation easily should any changes be made to the program's process in later cycles. The main purpose of this formatting is to allow you to organize and manage your automations. TIP! If your automation performs multiple actions, be sure to include both actions in your title to help you find it later. An example of this would be ""Move & Email: Application Form Completed."" Organize automations into Folders When many automations have been added to a single program, it is easy to become overwhelmed when trying to locate a specific automation. It is recommended to make use of Automation Folders to help with their organization. Adding folders with titles such as ""Move,"" ""Emails,"" and ""Date Activation"" are some examples based on actions your automations will perform, but you may find that it is more practical to name folders following the custom application labels or statuses you have created for your programs. To create a new folder from the Automations page: Select the Folders icon Select Create New Add a name for the Folder Select OK To add an automation to a folder from the Automations page: Mark the automation Select Folders Select the folder that best describes your automation NOTE: Automations can only be associated with one folder at a time. Tracking Automation Logs To view a searchable log of previous instances where automations have fired, administrators can select the View Logs icon from the Automations page. This can be helpful for troubleshooting applications that did not follow the process as expected and to determine if an automation fired/misfired for an application. The log will display: the title of the automation the activation that caused the automation to fire the date and time it fired the title of the application the automation is Related to the name of the actor who caused the automation to fire.

Navigating the Connect Apps tab Manage your Quick Actions The Connect apps section of your survey is the place to connect your survey data to your business apps to automate data sharing, collaborate smarter, and save time. Automating with quick actions helps to improve information sharing, iterate on survey feedback, and save time. Quick Actions Quick actions are simple automations that connect SurveyMonkey responses to popular business apps, like: Post notifications to Slack or Microsoft Teams to share targeted data with the right people, as responses roll in. Posting to these apps can help surface new ideas, channel feedback, or escalate something so teams can take action faster. Export responses to Excel or Google Sheets to share in-the-moment data with your team, which you can merge with other key data for deeper insights. Data selection and filtering When setting up quick actions, you can choose whether to act on all response data or target responses when a respondent selects a specific answer. Targeting the response data helps you channel the right survey data to the right people, making your quick action more relevant, usable, and efficient.

How to Authenticate your Custom Email Sender Address,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/features/custom-sender-address/,"How to Authenticate your Custom Email Sender Address | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Advantages of Authenticating your Email Email Authentication: Overview What to do if you're not sure what to do How to Enable Email Authentication How to Configure Email Authentication Configuration Help Features and Settings Emails How to Authenticate your Custom Email Sender Address Apply How to Authenticate your Custom Email Sender Address Advantages of Authenticating your Email Email Authentication: Overview What to do if you're not sure what to do How to Enable Email Authentication How to Configure Email Authentication Configuration If DKIM Email Authentication hasn't been enabled on your site yet, contact our support team for more information. To determine if this has been enabled, the default No Reply email visible in your settings should be noreply@mail.smapply.net . If it isn't noreply@mail.smapply.net , please contact our support team. Advantages of Authenticating your Email Currently, when you send emails from SurveyMonkey Apply they are being sent from the smapply.io email address. By authenticating your custom email sender address, emails will be sent from your organization's email address. As your email address is more likely to be recognized by your applicants and reviewers, your email is more likely to be received and not get caught in spam filters. Email Authentication: Overview Email Authentication uses two DNS records to verify that we can send emails on behalf of your domain. The first, DKIM, uses a TXT Record to validate the email address and is required to use the custom email address on the site. Without a verified DKIM you will not be able to select your custom email address from the list of email addresses and it will be marked as unverified. The second record is a CNAME and is only required if you want the Return-Path header to align with your sender email address. The CNAME should be added for the subdomain that you have configured your custom email address to use. For example, if your sender email address is apply@ mail.siteurl.com , the CNAME record should be created for mail.siteurl.com with the value shown in the Value field, which will mark the Return-Path as also mail.siteurl.com . While this isn’t required, it is a best practice to enable this as some receiving mail servers may check the Return-Path to see if the sender’s domain matches the Return-Path domain in an effort to prevent phishing. Once you have added the DNS records, click Verify to verify the email address. The system will verify that the records exist on the domain, and if they are valid, a verified icon will appear on the DNS Records section as well as under the Verification Status column on the Email Settings page. NOTE: The DNS Records may take up to 48 hours to propagate for your domain, so if it does not verify the first time you try, please wait and try verifying again later. What to do if you're not sure what to do When attempting to set up this process, it is highly recommended to send this information to your IT department/individual to assist you with updating your email domain settings. If your organization doesn't have someone knowledgeable in configuring DKIM or you just aren't able to make changes to your email settings, we would not recommend using a Custom Email Sender. Instead, it is best to use the system's default email address noreply@mail.smapply.net . You can, however, update the name that the email is received from. In the Email settings of your site instead of it being ""SurveyMonkey Apply"" < noreply@mail.smapply.net > you can set it up as ""Your Organization Name"" < noreply@mail.smapply.net > so that your recipients still know the email is coming from you. How to Enable Email Authentication To enable Email Authentication if this functionality isn't available, please contact our support team . How to Configure Email Authentication Before you Start NOTE: Administrative access to your domain’s DNS records is required to complete the configuration, so if you do not have administrative access, please contact your organization’s IT department to ensure you will be able to make the following changes. When adding a Custom Email Address to a site with Email Authentication enabled, it is recommended that you use a subdomain for the email address as this will allow you to align the Return-Path field with your domain as well. While this helps to improve email deliverability by having the return-path email address match the domain of the sender address, unfortunately, it will also mean that you can’t use a real email address as your Custom Email Address since a CNAME would affect access to your real organization’s site. If you wish to use a real email address to configure Email Authentication you can, however, you will not be able to configure the CNAME and emails sent from your site will have the default return-path used instead. Configuration To use Email Authentication : Click Add Custom Email on the Email Settings page Enter your custom email address as well as a name for it and click Add & Continue The next step requires administrative access to your domain name to add the required DNS records. The Edit custom email address box will be shown and includes the values for the DKIM and CNAME records that should be added to authenticate the email address. The DKIM record is required, while the CNAME is optional if you wish to align your Return-Path email address with your sender address.

How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/branching-logic/,"How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Add Branching Logic Common Use Cases Help Build Forms How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form Apply How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form How to Add Branching Logic Common Use Cases Branching Logic can be used within your form to customize the behaviour of a form based on the responses that a user gives to a question within the form. For example, when a user selects Choice A from one question, you can choose to hide the following question, if it no longer applies given the previous response. How to Add Branching Logic Choose to add Branching Logic if you wish to perform an action within your form. This could be based on a given response to a question, whether a selection to a multiple choice, or checkbox, for example, or a specific response to a text response question. To add Branching Logic to a form: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard icon Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Under the Rule Condition , select a filter from the drop-down. The question chosen will trigger the branching rule. Optional: Add additional rules by clicking the Add Rule icon. If you choose to add more than one condition you can select ANY or ALL conditions to be met in order for the logic to occur. Under Rule Actions , click the Select an action drop-down Select an action from the list Enter many actions by clicking on the next line that appears after you’ve entered the first action. Click Save Rule when you’re done. You will return to the main branching logic page where you can set up more rules. You can also drag and drop the existing rules to reorder them in the list to keep them organized. Once you have set and saved all your rules individually, Click Save on the Main Branching logic page Save the form in order for these changes to appear to your users. Available Rule Actions Every branching logic condition has an action that will occur when the Rule Conditions have been met. The available actions are divided into 3 logic types: Branching Dynamic Advanced Branching Option Brief Description Skip to Page Select a future page in your form to skip to once the Condition has been met and the user attempts to proceed to the next page. Complete the form Return to the application page. This will mark the current task as ""Complete"". Based on the Rule Action you can state that when the user selects their responses and attempts to proceed to the next page they will be redirected out of the form and the task will be marked as complete. Terminate the form Return to the application page. This will mark the task as ""Incomplete"". Based on the Rule Action you can state that when the user selects their responses and attempts to proceed to the next page they will be redirected out of the form and the task will be marked as incomplete. Skip to a Random Page Enter page numbers separated by commas. Once the condition has been met and the user proceeds to the Next page. They will be sent to a random page based on your list. Dynamic Option Brief Description Hide a question Based on a response, hide a question from the user. Show a question Based on a response, show a question to the user. NOTE: The question selected to show will automatically be hidden until the Rule Condition has been fulfilled. Disable a question Disabling a question will make it so that its choices and variables cannot be selected, e.g. grayed out. Mark as an invalid question Marking a question as invalid will make it so that an error message appears above that question preventing the user from continuing to the next page or submitting the form. The error message that appears can be customized. Hide a page Based on a response, hide a page from the user. TIP! Use this action if there are multiple questions that you wish to hide based on a user's response. You can add all of these questions to a page. Advanced Option Brief Description Redirect to a URL Redirect the user to a website based on a given response. This action will occur when they click Next or Submit. Randomly Traverse a Page Range Enter page numbers separated by commas. The user will proceed through all pages, however, the order of the pages will be randomly chosen. Common Use Cases There are many possible use cases in which you may choose to use Branching Logic within your form. The below scenarios will walk through how to set up these various use cases. Terminate a Form Show a Question Show a Message or Warning Hide a Question Permanently 1. Terminate the Form For this scenario, we will walk through how to Terminate the form for a user so that based on a certain response they will be redirected to the main Application page and the task will remain Incomplete. For this example, we want to ensure that the applicant has completed a certain action. For example, ""Have you completed your CPR training?"" The applicant can then choose from the available multiple choice responses, Yes or No. In order for the applicant to complete the rest of the form, they must have obtained their CPR training. Therefore, if they answer No to the question they will be unable to proceed and will be redirected out of the form. However, they may have time to complete their training and therefore will still be able to enter the form and change their answer at a later date. To set up a rule that will Terminate the form given a certain response: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the question ""Have you completed your CPR training?"" from the dropdown. ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value Is Exactly"" iii. Set the Item of the filter to ""No"" Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Terminate the form 2. Show a Question Another common scenario is to show questions based on a certain response to a question. Expanding on the example above, applicants are presented with the Multiple Choice question, ""Do you have any other certifications?"" where the applicant can select either 'Yes' or 'No.' Using Branching Logic, you can state that if the applicant selects 'Yes', then the Question ""Please list other certifications below."" will appear. However, prior to the response being selected the question will not be visible by default. The setup of this is: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the question ""Do you have any other certifications?"" ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value Is Exactly"" iii. Set the Item of the filter to ""Yes"" Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Show a Question ii. Select the question you wish to show: ""Please list other certifications below."" 3. Show a Message or Warning This scenario also follows the Show a Question action for branching logic. However, in this scenario, we don't want to show another question we just want to show additional information or text. If this is the case you can add a Section Heading to your form directly below the affected question. Using the same example of Terminate the Form we want to ensure that an applicant has completed their CPR training, and if they haven't then they will be redirected out of the form. However, we want to let them know why they will be redirected out of the form. To do so, we can add a Section Heading question to the form that will double as a warning message that says: ""We require that you have completed your CPR training in order to complete this form. If you have not completed your training you will be redirected out of the form and will be unable to proceed until the training has been completed."" As we only want this to show if they have selected No, we can use the Show Question branching logic to show the Section Heading question text when No is selected. To add this rule: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the question ""Have you completed your CPR training?"" from the dropdown. ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value Is Exactly"" iii. Set the Item of the filter to ""No"" Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Show a Question ii. Select the question the action should occur for: ""We require that you have completed your CPR training..."" 4. Hide a Question Permanently In some cases, you may require a question to be permanently hidden in the form so that it is no longer visible to your users. A common reason is if your application requirements have changed and the question is no longer applicable. This ensures that the question and previously collected responses are not deleted from the form. To set up this scenario: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the first question in your form. ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value has a response"" iii. Click Add Rule iv. Click on the Filter dropdown and again select the first question in your form. v. This time set the parameter to ""Value has no response"" vi. Set the rules so that ""Match Any of the following rules"" is selected Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Hide a Question ii.

The following information will help you get started analyzing in your SPSS program: Expand | Collapse Variable View vs. Data View The Variable View defines each question and answer choices. The Data View is a spreadsheet-style view with all the responses. Questions are labeled as q0001, q0002, q0003, and so on. You can edit these labels in the cells of the Variable View, which updates the column headers of the Data View. Answer choices are assigned both a numeric value and a variable label name. Use the Variable View to reference the values and names. In the Data View, click View > Value Labels in the toolbar to show the variable label names instead of the numeric values. Measure & Question Types Measure Measure is determined from the question type . Scale = Ranking and Numerical Textbox questions Nominal = all other question types Multiple Choice SPSS assigns a numeric value to answer choices, which you can reference in the Variable View. If multiple answers are allowed, the data will be separated into multiple columns in the Data View since multiple answers cannot exist in one cell. Ranking and Matrix Questions The data is separated into multiple columns (as many columns as you have in your question). SPSS assigns the numeric value by the weighted value, which is not necessarily how you have the answer choices ordered in the survey. This means column one is whatever answer choice was assigned the weight of 1 in the survey, column two is the answer choice with the weight of 2, and so on. The N/A column is coded as 0. If you assigned the weight of 0 to another answer choice, the cell will show .00 and you'll need to manually fix this.

Help Monitor How to Archive Applications Apply How to Archive Applications Archiving Applications vs. Moving to Trash How to Archive Applications Viewing Archived Applications Restoring Archived Applications How Does Changing Live Data Affect Archived Applications? If you wish to store applications within your SurveyMonkey Apply site for future reporting, you may do so by archiving these applications. This article discusses how to safely archive applications for future use. Archiving Applications vs. Moving to Trash The key difference between the two options is mainly for organizational purposes. In most cases, Archived Applications refer to applications that have gone through most, if not all, of the application process in a previous year or cycle. They allow you to organize that those applications were real applications that passed through your process. Deleted Applications, however, are typically applications that are incomplete, or were used for testing. For more information in regards to Deleted or Trashed Applications, you can refer to How to Move Applications to Trash . How to Archive Applications Archiving applications will keep your report data accurate, applicant portal clean, and application management easy so that you only see new applications. If an application is archived incorrectly, the action can be reverted. See Restoring Archived Applications below for steps to recover these applications. How to Manually Archive Applications To archive an application from Manage Applications: Go to Manage Applications . Select applications to mark as archived. Select More . Select Archive . How to Automatically Archive Applications In order to archive an application automatically in the site: This example will walk through the setup of an Automation where we want to archive all applications that have been moved to the Ineligible Holding stage in our workflow. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Application has changed stage Ineligible CONDITIONS Not Required for this Scenario DO Action Source Action Application Archive the Application Viewing Archived Applications When an application is archived the data that was collected is still accessible to administrators. It can be viewed as an application similar to how an active application is viewed and data from that application can be pulled into reports. To view all archived applications within your site: Go to Manage Applications . Update the filter drop-down menu to archived applications. To see material within the archived application, select the application title to enter the administrator application view . Restoring Archived Applications If an application is archived in error, the application can be reactivated ultimately reverting the error. To restore an archived application: Go to Manage Applications . Access your archived applications from the filter drop-down menu. Select applications that need their status reverted. Select More . Select Unarchive . How Does Changing Live Data Affect Archived Applications? Changes to your workflow may affect archived and trashed applications. For example, if you delete a question from a form, the answers to that question will be deleted from all applications using that form. This would include all active and inactive applications (Archived and Trashed). Additionally, when a task is deleted from your workflow, the information captured by that task will also be deleted from any archived or trashed applications. For more information, you can also refer to How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form which details the cautions of what editing a form can do to your existing data.

If you have multiple collectors for the same survey keep in mind that: To completely stop collecting responses for your survey, you need to close each collector individually You can customize the survey closed message for each collector individually Closing one collector won't close other collectors Troubleshooting Collector Issues Review these common issues that arise when opening and closing collectors. I closed my collector but my survey is still getting responses You may have another collector that’s still open. If you have multiple collectors for the same survey, you need to close each collector individually to turn the survey completely off. I closed my collector but my scheduled message is still stuck in pending When your collector is closed, any pending messages are stuck as pending and won’t be sent—you can’t unschedule or delete pending messages. If you want to send a message, open the collector and schedule a new one. After everyone is done taking the survey and all messages have been sent, close the collector again. I can’t reopen my survey Check if you’ve set a Cutoff Date and Time or Response Limits on your collector. If so, you need to extend the date or increase the max number of responses in your collector settings before you can reopen your survey. Related Articles Can I merge surveys or survey results?

Proper Formatting for INDEXOF Expressions Formatting the INDEXOF Expression Common Uses of the INDEXOF Function Examples: Finding the Index of a Character within a String NDEXOF a Character Within a Text Response Question (Single Character) INDEXOF a Character Within a Text Response Question (Multiple Characters) INDEXOF a Character Within a Single Cell Help Advanced Features How to Find the Index of a Character within a String (INDEXOF) Apply How to Find the Index of a Character within a String (INDEXOF) What is the INDEXOF Function? Proper Formatting for INDEXOF Expressions Formatting the INDEXOF Expression Common Uses of the INDEXOF Function Examples: Finding the Index of a Character within a String NDEXOF a Character Within a Text Response Question (Single Character) INDEXOF a Character Within a Text Response Question (Multiple Characters) INDEXOF a Character Within a Single Cell Using Advanced Expression Piping within your forms you can create mathematical formulas in order to calculate a value. Use INDEXOF to reference the location of a character/value within a string. What is the INDEXOF Function? The INDEXOF function allows for two string values to be used and returns the index of the second value within the first value. The indexing of the values starts at 0 In the case where the value is not found the response will return –1 If ""example"" is the first value and we're looking for ‘x’ within it, the expression would return 1. e=(0), x=(1), a=(3), etc. The index returned will only be the first instance of the value. Therefore, 'e' would return only 0 as the index even though there are two instances within the word ""example"" at 0 & 5. Proper Formatting for INDEXOF Expressions Formatting the INDEXOF Expression The setup and formatting of the INDEXOF expression is imperative in preventing an error message from appearing on your form where the result of your expression would normally appear. The first line of the INDEXOF expression should be set up as follows: {{ INDEXOF(variable,‘value’) }} TIP! The reference to variable in the expression above can be either the identifier of a question or the index of a field within a question. Each expression is always contained within a pair of double ""curly"" brackets {{ }} There should be a space between the first instance of INDEXOF and the last bracket Variables and values you are using are case sensitive Always close each INDEXOF operation with brackets ( ) To reference our previous example where we are locating the index of a value within the word ""example"", our expression could be: {{ INDEXOF(example,'x') }} = 1 {{ INDEXOF(example,'e') }} = 0 {{ INDEXOF(example,'s') }} = -1 Common Uses of the INDEXOF Function More commonly, the index of a value can be pulled from the response of a text response question or from a response of a specific cell within a grid. INDEXOF a Text Response Question {{ INDEXOF(q1,'a') }} Will tell us the index of the value 'a' within question 1. NOTE: In this example, q1 has been used as the identifier of question 1. INDEXOF a single cell {{ INDEXOF(q2[0],'@') }} Based on Grid Indexing, this will tell us the index of the value '@' within the first cell of question 2. Examples: Finding the Index of a Character within a String INDEXOF a Character Within a Text Response Question (Single Character) Consider a case where it is required to know the number of characters before the @ symbol within an email response field. The question where the email is requested from the applicant falls within a Single Column question with the identifier about and is the fifth subquestion within the grid question. Identifier: about Question reference: about.4 Expression: {{ INDEXOF(about.4, '@') }} User's response: email@email.com Index returned: 5 INDEXOF a Character Within a Text Response Question (Multiple Characters) Extending on the previous example, a group of characters can be used within the expression. In these cases, the index of the first character within the group of characters stated within the expression will be the index given in the response. Identifier: about Question reference: about.4 Expression: {{ INDEXOF(about.4, '.com') }} User's response: email@email.com Index returned: 11 INDEXOF a Character Within a Single Cell If identifying information is collected using a multi-column question as names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc., we would need to adjust the formatting of the expression in order to target a single cell within the grid. Identifier: about Question reference: about[1] Expression: {{ INDEXOF(about[1], '@') }} User response: email@email.com Index returned: 5 Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"
Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/integrations/google-tag-manager-integration/,"Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Before You Start Creating your GetFeedback for Web Tag Installing In-Page with GTM Integrating GetFeedback with Google Analytics using GTM Help Integrations Push to data platforms Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration GetFeedback Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration Before You Start Creating your GetFeedback for Web Tag Installing In-Page with GTM Integrating GetFeedback with Google Analytics using GTM You can install GetFeedback Digital features on your site through Google Tag Manager (GTM). Before You Start You'll need 3 things to implement the button on your website through GTM: A GetFeedback combicode script, obtained by creating a button or from your Customer Success Manager A basic understanding of Google Tag Manager Access to Google Tag Manager Creating your GetFeedback for Web Tag To create your web tag: Open Google Tag Manager . Navigate to the workspace for the page you want to implement GetFeedback for Web. Select New Tag . Name your tag, then select Tag configuration . Select the Custom HTML tag. Paste the GetFeedback combicode script in the input field. Insert the tag as HTML, including the opening (<script type=""text/javascript"">) and closing (</script) tags. Select the Support document write option directly below the input field. Define triggers for your tag To define your triggers: Select Triggering to define on which pages your tag should be shown. Make sure to use the ""Window loaded"" trigger type. You can decide to show your tag on all pages of your website (recommended) or you can exclude certain pages from seeing a feedback button. If available, you can select an existing trigger for your GetFeedback Digital tag or you can create a new one. Once you defined your tag triggering, it's time to save your tag and publish the changes to your container to publish the GetFeedback Digital feedback button on your web page. Feedback button structure After installing the GetFeedback for Web tag with GTM, you will be able to control the feedback buttons, forms, and surveys in your GetFeedback Digital account. We recommend you install feedback buttons on your entire website, so they’re available when and wherever your visitors want to provide feedback. Typically, our customers use one desktop feedback button and one mobile feedback button per domain website. These desktop and mobile buttons can be combined into one script. Simply reach out and we'll be happy to create the combined script for you. If you need to exclude one or a few select pages from seeing the button, use one of our javascript API calls to make the button invisible. Learn more about our javascript API calls View raw code here. Installing In-Page with GTM Make sure to install the 2 code snippets that Google provides. Once logged into your Google Tag Container, click the Container ID to find the code snippets. Learn more Normally, when you install In-Page on your web page, you'll add a <div> tag that acts as a container for the In-Page widget. This logic stays the same when you're implementing In-Page through a tag manager. The only difference is we'll be inserting both the <div> container and the In-Page script using the tag manager. Since you’ll be adding the In-Page <div> container with the tag manager, you’ll need a reference anchor on the page that the tag manager can use to add an In-Page <div> container to your page’s DOM tree. The easiest way to do this is by adding an ID to the element to which you want to append the In-Page widget. For example, a <div> with the ID ""usbl-inpage-anchor"" in the footer of an article. When you have your anchor ready, it's time to add In-Page to your tag manager. You’ll do this by adding 2 tags to the tag manager: the Widget Code and the Script. The widget code is the placeholder <div> where the in-page widget will be injected. The In-Page script is the code that injects the In-Page widget into the container. Because of how In-Page works you'll always have 1 tag per In-page Widget Code and 1 In-Page tag per In-Page script. Ideally, you'll want to use 1 In-Page script per domain and use multiple In-Page widgets with that In-Page script. First, we'll add the In-Page widget container in the tag manager. To do so in GTM go to the main page and click on ""Add Tag"". In the tag selection screen, select ""Custom HTML Tag"". Using the Custom HTML Tag allows us to define our tag. In the first tag for adding the In-Page Widget container, we'll be adding a piece of JavaScript to search for the In-Page anchor and appends the In-Page Widget container to that element. The easiest way to do this is by using a jQuery function, alternatively, you can use vanillaJS. Below you'll find examples of both ways. View raw code here. When you've added the code to the tag you'll need to make sure the ""Support document.write"" option is enabled and that the tag is fired once per event. If you've done this you can move on and make sure the triggering options are set correctly. The triggering options specify when the tag should be 'fired' and the code in the tag is run. Since we're appending the In-Page widget container to an existing web page we'll need to set the 'Firing triggers' rules in such a way that the trigger only fires when the page is fully loaded. To do so we create a new trigger with the trigger type set to ""Page View"". You can add additional rules for the trigger but for now just leave the trigger set to fire on every Page View. Finish the first tag by saving both the tag as well as the trigger. You can save the tag as ""usbl-inpage-container-tag"" and the tag as ""usbl-allpages-trigger"". If you're planning to add a lot of different In-Page widgets, it's good practice to use the GTM folder feature. The second step is to add the In-Page script for injecting the In-Page widget into the In-Page widget container. Just like before you'll add a new tag using the ""Custom HTML Tag"" template. In this tag, you'll add the <script> snippet from the installation page of your In-Page Widget. When you've added the In-Page script tag you'll need to set triggering rules. Like the In-Page container tag, you’ll the rule to trigger on every Page View. It's best to keep this trigger separate from the one we made earlier. Finish up the second tag by saving it using a similar name to what you used earlier, like "" usbl-inpage-script-tag "". After saving the second tag, we'll need to make a small adjustment to the settings of the first tag. What we'll need to do is set the Tag Sequencing. Tag Sequencing allows you to set a sequence of your tags. We need to enable this setting since the In-Page script code can only inject the In-Page widget when the In-Page container is already on the page. In the first tag go to Advanced Setting. In the Advanced Settings open the "" Tag Sequencing "" dropdown and check the ""Fire a tag after usbl-inpage-container-tag fired"". After you've checked this setting an additional dropdown will appear where you can select a ""Cleanup Tag"". In the dropdown, you'll need to select the tag that has the In-Page script that is associated with the In-Page Widget container that you're editing. In our example that would be ""usbl-inpage-container-tag"". To finish up the settings part tick the checkbox saying ""Don't fire usbl-inpage-script-tag if usbl-inpage-container-tag fails"". Doing so makes sure we're not running code when the container is not available. Save your tags and triggers, then publish your workspace to see the results. The in-page widget should now be added to your web page using Google Tag Manager. Advanced Usage Using a tag manager for implementing In-Page provides you with a lot of flexibility. The reason is that Google Tag Manager allows you to change the In-Page widget on the fly or even change when the widget shows up, based on custom triggers. How this is done depends on your web page’s setup, like if you have a data layer or store parameters in the URL. To get you started, we've made a short list of ideas: Changing the In-Page widget based on language Changing the In-Page widget based on platform Changing the In-Page widget based on browser Changing the In-Page widget based on customer type Hiding the In-Page widget based on language Integrating GetFeedback with Google Analytics using GTM You can also integrate GetFeedback button data into Google Analytics (GA) using Google Tag Manager’s (GTM) data layer.

Adding and Managing Pages,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/managing-pages/,"Adding and Managing Pages | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Adding Pages Managing Pages Page Titles and Descriptions Page Numbers Page Logic Help Creating Surveys Using Survey Pages Adding and Managing Pages SurveyMonkey Adding and Managing Pages Adding Pages Managing Pages Page Titles and Descriptions Page Numbers Page Logic Breaking your survey into multiple pages can help you organize a longer survey into manageable chunks so respondents feel they are making progress as they take it, and every time they go to the next page, their partial responses get saved. Adding Pages There are a few options to break your survey up into multiple pages: Add an Intro page to the beginning of your survey, Add a New page to the end of the survey, or Add a Page break to split up your questions into multiple pages. From the bottom of the Build menu on the Design Survey tab, you can drag and drop these page elements into the appropriate spot within your survey. Or, on your survey design preview, there are buttons to + Page break between questions and + New Page at the end of each survey page. If you're using a touch screen, you may not see the + Page break button. It isn’t possible to undo adding a Page break. But you can delete the newly created page and select Move questions to the page above or below to revert the action. Managing Pages At the top of any survey page, the More Actions menu offers the following options: Action Description Copy page Duplicate the page and choose where to place it in the survey. All of the questions on the page are copied, but logic such as Page skip logic or Page randomization are not applied to the copied version (unless Page randomization is applied to all questions in the survey). Move page Move the page to another position in the survey. Any Page skip logic and Page randomization will remain applied to the page, so make sure to test the logic paths thoroughly before sending to respondents. Edit page info Edit the Page title and Page description. Delete page Remove the page from your survey. You can choose to delete all its questions, or move them to the previous or next page. Page Titles and Descriptions Click + Page Title directly at the top of any page in your survey design to add a page title or description. If you want to hide Page titles, disable the toggle in from the Options menu—the Page title will be hidden, however the Page description continues to display. If you don't want the Page description to display on your survey, make sure that field is empty. Page Numbers You can choose to show or hide page numbers from the Options menu. Page Logic Click Page Logic at the top of any page to apply Page skip logic , Question randomization , or Page randomization .

You can also refer to our Recommender FAQ article that can be shared with your recommenders to help them resolve commonly reported issues on their own. I see a 'no pending recommendations' message If a recommender contacts you because they have recently received a recommendation request, but are unable to see the recommendations within their panel, refer to the few potential reasons below. The application has been moved to the next stage of the application process In order for the recommender to be able to complete the recommendation task, the application will need to be within the stage that the recommender task exists. Go to your Workflow Locate the recommendation task within the workflow and make note of the name of the stage. Now go to Manage Applications Search for the application that requested a recommendation from this recommender Confirm that the Application is in the same stage as the recommender task. The applicant has rescinded their request for a recommendation within the site Confirm that the recommender contacting you has a current invite to recommend the application. Assume the role of the Applicant Click to access the application Click on the recommendation request to view the information of the recommender Confirm that the email address of the recommender contacting you matches the email that is displayed within the recommendation request. I am having trouble attaching my recommendation The recommendation task is a form and not an attachment If the recommender experiences difficulty attaching a recommendation letter: Confirm within the site that the recommendation task is, in fact, an attach a file task. Otherwise, if the task is an internal form, inform them that they will have to fill out the form and will not be able to attach a file The file is not in an accepted format Ask the recommender to send you their file(s) if they didn't do so already. Compare the format of the file with the accepted formats on the file. They are attempting to attach more than one file Ask the recommender to send you their file(s) if they didn't do so already. Confirm that they aren't trying to attach more files than the task allows them to. The file is encrypted SurveyMonkey Apply will not accept encrypted files. You will need to instruct them that in order to attach their file the encryption must be removed. The file is corrupted Have them re-save the file on their computer on a different location on their drive. Then advise them to attach the new version of the file to resolve the issue. A task related issue If none of the above are applicable, you can also refer to I can't edit the recommendation task below. I can't edit the recommendation task The deadline has passed for the stage/task If the recommender has reached out to you that they can't edit a task, first check to see if the deadline has passed for the task/ stage the application is in. Go to your Workflow Enter the Stage Configurations where the recommendation task exists Check the Stage deadline to confirm what the current date is and if it's correct. If there is no deadline on the stage, go to the Tasks tab Check the Task deadline to confirm what the current date is and if it's correct. If everything has been set up correctly, inform the recommender of the deadline. The open date has not yet occurred on the stage/task If the recommender has reached out to you that they can't edit a task, you can also check to ensure that if there are any Open dates on the stage/tasks, that it has already passed. Go to your Workflow Enter the Stage Configurations where the recommendation task exists Check the Stage open date to confirm what the current date is and if it's correct. If there is no open date on the stage, go to the Tasks tab Check the Task open date to confirm what the current date is and if it's correct.

This article explains how to apply filters to your Manage Applications page to view the applications that are important to you and the actions you are looking to complete. Overview Throughout this article, we will be referring to various icons and menus that are used to create, manage and apply filters to your applications. Below is a summary of these features as well as a brief description of what they do. Filter Definition Status Filter Menu Used to quickly toggle between active and inactive (archived, trashed) applications. Active Application Filter Displays active applications within a program. Active applications can be accessed from the Status Filter menu. Inactive Application Filters The term used to describe inactive applications which includes both the archived and trashed status. Inactive applications can be accessed from the Status Filter menu. Custom Filters Filters created using the Custom Filter builder. Custom filters can be saved for later use and shared with other administrators. Your Custom Filters Custom filters that are saved for later use, but not shared with other administrators.

Status Filter Menu Your status filter menu allows you to toggle between active and inactive applications. This filter applies in conjunction with any custom filters applied to the program's applications. Active applications will be shown by default when Manage Applications is accessed. To toggle between active and inactive applications: Select the dropdown menu shown above. Select a new status. Toggling between active and inactive filters will clear any existing custom filters applied to your applications. Be sure to save your custom filters before toggling this menu if you will be using the custom filter often going forward, but do not want to rebuild it. Custom Filters What is a Custom Filter? How to Add Custom Filters How to Remove a Custom Filter How to Apply Multiple Filters What is a Custom Filter? Custom filters are used to filter results in a variety of areas throughout an SM Apply site. When applying a filter to the Manage Applications page the custom filter will display results that satisfy all applied conditions within the filter. A single filter can consist of multiple conditions to target specific applications. There are three menus use to create a custom filter. The chart below provides a description of the terminology used to describe the custom filter builder within Manage Applications and references an example of a custom filter which would pull all applications that have not yet been declared awarded or rejected applications. Label Number Menu Example 1 Condition Decision 2 Matching parameter Equals 3 Value/Target Undecided How to Add Custom Filters When viewing applications from Manage Applications page you may wish to apply a custom filter to your list of applications. To add a custom filter: Select New Custom Filter . Choose your condition . Select your matching parameter . Set the required value . Select Apply . The example above demonstrates how to apply a custom filter to retrieve applications that have been submitted. Once the filter has been applied, a banner will appear titled with a short summary of the filter below the Condition menu. TIP! Interested in saving your custom filter for future use? See How to Save/Manage Custom Filters for more details. How to Remove a Custom Filter When a filter has been applied it will appear as a summarized banner directly below the custom filter builder. Removing a filter can be done by selecting the X within the banner of the filter(s) you would like to remove from the page. How to Apply Multiple Filters In some cases, more than one filter will be needed in order to retrieve the desired applications in your results list. To add multiple filters: Add your first filter following the steps in Add a Custom Filter or select a Saved Custom Filter . Select the Condition dropdown to begin creating the next filter. Select Apply. Repeat as necessary. Application Detail Filters The following group of filters is selected in the condition portion of your custom filter. The value of the filter will vary depending on the filter selected. Many of these filters are site-specific including stage names, label titles, and application IDs. Filter Description Title Filter by the Application title Application ID Filter by a value that is/is not found within the application ID. This is helpful when unique application ID prefixes are used for different cycles Current Stage Retrieve applications based on their current placement (stage) in the program workflow Label Display applications with/without specific labels Status Find applications with a specific status (withdrawn, active, rejected, etc.) Submit Date Search for applications submitted on a specific date or within a certain range Has Collaborators Filter applications based on whether they are being completed by a team of applicants or a single applicant. Date Created Search for applications created on a specific date or within a certain range Decision Retrieve applications based on the final decision (awarded, declined, undecided) Custom Field Filters Custom fields that target applications will be presented within the Application details category to assist in filtering applications. If a custom field is not appearing the Applicant Information category then it is not currently targeting the applicant role. For more information regarding Custom Fields, please see our documentation on How to Create a Custom Field . Applicant Information Filters Filter Description First Name Filter for applications created by a user with a certain character sequence in the applicant's first name. Last Name Filter for applications created by a user with a certain character sequence in the applicant's last name. Email Filter by a character sequence in the applicant's email address. Helpful when searching for applications created by users with a certain email domain. Applicant ID Search for applications created by a specific applicant Id. Applicant Ids are unique to each user. Last active in the system Search for applications whose users have been active within a certain timeframe. For example: apply a filter to see applications whose owners have not been active in the site for over one year. Roles Pull applications of users who are associated with certain roles.

For more information regarding Custom Fields, please see our documentation on How to Create a Custom Field . TIP! Interested in saving your custom filter for future use? See How to Save/Manage Custom Filters for more details. Application Stage Filters Application Stage Filter Sources Stage Completion Task Completion Form Responses Application Stage Filter Sources The filters below are found in the Application Stage condition category when creating a new filter in the Manage Applications page. These filters have additional choices required to complete a custom filter which are described later in this section. Filter Description Stage Completion Filters created from the stage completion source will verify the application against the completion of application stages within the program workflow. Unlike the Current Stage filter found within the Application Details category, only application stages can be selected. This filter is intended to check the completion of stages where applicants must complete tasks. Task Completion These filters can refer to the completion status of an application task in any application stage in the workflow. Only applicant tasks within your program can be selected to complete this filter. Form Responses The variable filters section will allow you to filter applications based on their responses to forms within your site. The options available in this section will be dependent on the form types and questions in your site. Stage Completion Multiple selections are required when applying a stage completion filter. As stated earlier, only application stages can be selected to complete this filter and verify whether an applicant has progressed to a certain stage in the program workflow. To apply a stage completion filter: Create a New Custom Filter . Select Application stages from the conditions dropdown. Select Stage completion . Select one of the application stages in the program's workflow. Set the filter parameters . Select the stage completion status (Submitted, Re-Opened, or Initialized). Click Apply . The example above will filter for applications that submitted applications in the Application Stage. This will not include applications that are currently in that stage unless they have submitted the application while within that stage. The variable filters section will allow you to filter applications based on their responses to forms within your site. Task Completion These filters can refer to the completion status of an application task in any application stage in the workflow. Because the filters applied here are to filter the applications that appear in your results, only tasks that are completed by the applicant can be used for this filer. TIP! If you are looking for applications that were given a certain score or were graded with a certain response from reviewers within a review form, use the Review Stages category filters to reference questions asked within one of your review forms. The filter applied above is used to filter for applications that have not completed the application task titled ""Upload Task."" The filter will check the current status of the task, meaning that if the applicant completed the ""Upload Task"" previously and then deleted the file, the application would be included in this filter because the current status would be considered ""Not Started."" Form Response Filters The options available in this section will be dependent on the form types and questions in your site. For most of the question types you will be given the criteria to select whether or not the question/variable has a response or has no response. This can be helpful when trying to determine a user's progress in the form, or perhaps if the question type is optional and you want to see who responded to it.

Provided that it has a target of Programs, the field will be displayed here and within every Program in your site. You can enter associated information for this program in this field. Program Categories Add a program to a category to help organize your programs. If you already have a list of program categories in your site, they will be listed here. To add a New Category : Click Create New Enter the Category Name Select OK To add a program to a category: Select the checkbox beside the Category Name Select Save Review Score Format Select how to display the review scores of reviewers within your site. The format selected will appear for other reviewers if result sharing is enabled. Completed review scores for an application will only be visible to a reviewer once they have completed their review for the given application. Display Format Description Percentage The score of the review is presented as a percentage Actual Value The score of the review is presented as a whole number Percentage + Actual Value Both formats are displayed to reviewers The Workflow Designer The Workflow Designer is a bird's eye view of the process that an application will be guided through based on its success in the application process from the application stage to the review stage and the final decision process. This is the area where new tasks are added and existing tasks can be accessed for editing. How to Access the Workflow When you have first created your program and have not yet launched the program will still be in Edit (Build) Mode. To access the Workflow from Build Mode: If you are in the Site Dashboard , click on Workflow located within the Tile of the Program you wish to edit. If you are on the Program Settings Page, or the Automation Page within Build Mode, click on Workflow at the top of the page. To access a program workflow after your application has launched and you are in Monitor Mode: If you are in the Site Dashboard , click on the More Options icon in the top right corner of tile. Click Edit Program . If you are in the Dashboard, Applications, or Review tab, click on Edit Program Stages Within SM Apply there are four types of stages: Applicant, Simple Review, Advanced Review, and Holding Stages. The type of stage will define the tasks that can exist within the stage. When a program is first created an Application Stage will populate automatically. Types of Stages Stage Type Description Applicant This stage consists of the tasks that will be displayed to your applicants Simple Review This stage contains a Simple Review task. The Simple Review tasks can be setup quickly and are usually based on a rating scale. For example 1 out of 10, or x out of 5 stars. They are slightly customizable and are limited to basic questions. NOTE: You will only be able to create one Simple Review task within each Simple Review stage. Advanced Review This stage is used when you require more extensive reviews of applications. For example, your review may include multiple questions and comments, or weighted scores on your reviews. NOTE: You will only be able to create one Advanced Review task within each Advanced Review stage. Holding No tasks exist within this stage. Holding stages are commonly used if you wish to move your applications to a stage but there are no tasks to complete. Common examples are ""Awarded/Accepted Applications"" or ""Rejected/ Declined Applications."" The Order of Stages The order of stages in your Workflow is very important as it determines the flow of your application process. When an application is first created it will be automatically placed into the first stage in your workflow, unless otherwise configured using automations. You can choose to rearrange the stages in your workflow to ensure that all stages are in the correct order by hovering your cursor over the stage and using the Move icon to drag the stage to a new position. How to Add a New Stage In order to create a new stage: Go to your Workflow. Click on the + icon below your list of current stages Select the type of stage to create: Application, Holding, Simple Review or Advanced Review Enter a name for your stage Applicant tasks can be built within application stages only and multiple tasks can exist within a single application stage. Similarly, review tasks can only be created in a simple or advanced review stage, but the stages are limited to a single task. Holding stages are holding stages for applications and do not have associated tasks. Applicant Tasks To access the Tasks section of the stage Go to your Workflow Click on the Name of the Stage Click on Tasks Within an Application Stage you need applicant tasks for your applicants to be able to complete within your site. To add a task: Click on the + icon Select the type of task you wish to create Modify the task settings as required There are six applicant tasks ready for use in an application stage for your program workflow: Fill out a Form File Upload Complete an External Task Get a Recommendation Make a Payment Verify Charity Status Forms How to Edit the Form Titl e When a form is first created, the form title inherits the form name. However, if you wish to edit it: Click on the Header within the Form Builder to open the Options section on the left Enter the new title you wish to give within the title field Optional: Use the Visual Editor to customize the styling of the title Add/Edit the Form Description The Form Description can be extremely useful if you wish to provide details and instructions to your applicants in regards to the steps they need to take to complete the form. Commonly, administrators will also enter their own contact details in case an applicant has any questions while filling out the form. To add or edit the Form Description: Click on the Header within the Form Builder to open the Options section on the left Enter the description you wish to add to the form Optional: Use the Visual Editor to customize the formatting of the form description. NOTE: If you have multiple pages in the form, the Title and Description will appear at the top of every page. Previewing your Form The Preview button is located at the bottom of your page within the form builder. Clicking on Preview will open a new tab where you can test your form. The form will appear almost exactly as it would to your user. Since you are previewing the form as an administrator, you will also see any Hidden Questions or JavaScript Questions; however, these will not be visible to your regular applicants. NOTE: If your form contains Piping Variables used to pipe information from another form, or to pipe information specific to the user, these piping variables will not work correctly within the preview and the field will appear blank. If you wish to test your Piping Variables we would recommend using a test application. Page Labels Page labels allow you to create named pages of your form that can then branch or jump users to. Page labels do not have a character type restriction, eg., #@!&$%, or character limit. To change the page label: Click on the Page tab within the form’s editor Under ""Page Label"" input your new page title . The new name will apply to that page. Repeat this step for each page Add Questions Adding questions to your form is how you will build your form(s). You can add questions in two ways. To add a question to the middle of the page: Click on the Questions tab on the left side of the Form Builder Click and Drag the question type you wish to add and place it wherever you need to within the page you are on. To add a question to the end of the page: Click on the Questions tab on the left side of the Form Builder Double Click on the question type to have it added to the very end of the page you are on Bulk Editor In the case that you have a long list of choices or variables, or a list that you will be re-using often throughout your many forms, it may be useful to use the bulk editor. The bulk editor converts lists into choices/variables/rows, while giving you the option of saving them for use on any future question. The Bulk feature is available under all ""Choices"" and ""Variables"" on the left-hand floating editor box. Section Description Load a Preset Select from 1 of 23 available presets. Save a Preset If a preset is not available, you can create one for later use. Editor You can edit a preset after the fact. However, any changes made will not save unless it is as a custom preset. Additionally, you can also save custom bulk lists. To create a custom bulk list: Click on the “Bulk” button when adding choices, variables, rows or columns to a question. Once the dialog appears, write or paste your list into the text field. Make sure that each item in the list is on a separate line. Enter a name for your list and click Apply . Visual Editor The visual editor allows you to add text, videos, links, and more to your form. The editor is available in the Form Title and Form Description, but not in Choices or Variables. To access the visual editor: Click on the question title or extra description text box in the Options panel. Click on the Open Visual Editor button beneath the text box. Edit your text using the options available in the visual editor. Click OK . Click the Source button within the visual editor to input HTML, or CSS. While JavaScript can be placed in the source, we recommend that you place it in a JavaScript question type instead so that you can find it easily if you need to revisit the form in the future. Editing a Live Form This information is important to ensure that changes in your form do not impact your data! If you are deleting questions/ choices, or restructuring a form these actions could delete or skew your responses. For more information in regards to this we highly recommend referring to the article How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form to ensure that you are not making changes that will negatively affect your data. Automations Overview Automations can be used to perform actions based on the activity of applications, completion of assignments, date activations, and more. There are two areas where automations are managed: the Stage Configuration page, and the Automations page for your Program. Setup Feature Description Name The name of the automation as it appears throughout the site. Folder The folder associated with the automation. Folders are used to help organize automations for the programs within your site. NOTE: A folder is limited to appearing within the program where it was created and will not appear in any other program within your site. Advanced Settings Select Show Advanced Settings to reveal Limit, Priority, and Delay settings that the automation will follow. Limit Set the limit for the maximum number of times this automation will fire within the site. WARNING! This a site-wide setting. If you set the limit to 1, this automation will only trigger once on the site - not once per application. Priority Set a priority for the automation so that if another automation fires off of the same activation, one of the automations will always fire before or after the other. The higher the number the higher the Priority. NOTE: If priority is used, it should be enabled and set for all automations using that same activation. Delay Enable to delay the action from occurring if the activation and rules have been set. Hours and Days are available as intervals to create the delay. When to Apply The WHEN TO APPLY section is also known as the Activation and refers to when the automation will fire and verify that all conditions have been met. To set an activation properly the menus below must be configured. NOTE: In some cases a target will not be required. Menu Description Source The source of the Event. Event The activation that will cause the automation to fire if the rules are met. For example: the completion of a task, the creation of an application, when a review is completed, etc. Target Will appear if the source refers to a specific task. Targets the specific task that will prompt the automation to fire. Conditions Conditions are the rules of the automation and these rules determine if the automation will perform the actions within the DO Statement after the activation has been triggered. Matching Criteria ALL: all rules listed must be met in order for the automation to fire ANY: one or more rules must be met for the automation to fire Options Add a new rule Remove an existing rule Nest rules together to use a combination of the ALL or ANY matching criteria D O Statement The DO Statement consists of all of the actions that will be performed if the activation is triggered and all/any of the conditions have been satisfied. Options Adjust the order the actions will follow Remove an action Add a new action Stage Automations Stage Automations are configured from the stage settings from the Stage Automations tab and always consist of a rule that the application is currently in that given stage. Only automations with a condition of ""application is in stage"" will appear in this area. To access the automations of a specific stage: Enter the program workflow Select the stage that is associated with the new automation Select the Stage Automations tab To create or edit a stage automation: From the Stage Automations tab, select one of the templates to get you started OR select Create Automations Create a title for your automation Optional: Select an existing folder or create a new folder to organize your automation To set a limit, priority, or delay select Advanced Settings and enable as required Set the WHEN TO APPLY Statement for the automation and select Set Activation when finished Optional: Select additional Conditions or rules that will have to met for the automation to fire and perform the set actions Select the DO Statements or actions that the automation will perform NOTE: Once a stage automation has been configured it will appear with your other program automations within the automations page as well as within the Stage Automations tab of stage it is related to. Program Automations Program Automations are configured from the Automations tab which can be selected while in Build Mode for a program. These automations do not require a rule that they are associated with a specific stage. To enter the Automations page where all automations related to the program are listed: Enter Edit Mode for that program Select the Automations tab To create or edit a new program automation: From the Automations page select Create Automation Create a title for your automation that will allow you to easily locate it on a later date. Optional: Select a folder to associate with your automation Configure the WHEN TO APPLY, CONDITIONS, and DO Statement Select Save NOTE: Once an automation is created it will not immediately be active until the status is updated to Active. Editing Automations Editing automations can be done from the automations page regardless of whether it is a stage or program automation. Stage automations can be accessed for editing in both locations while program automations that were not created from the Stage Automation page can only be accessed from the Automations tab while in Edit mode. Activating and Deactivating Automations When an automation is created it must be ACTIVE in order for it to fire. To activate an automation from the Automation Page: Mark the automation to activate Select the Actions icon Select Activate To deactivate an automation from the Automation Page: Select the automation to deactivate Select the Actions icon Select Deactivate Automation Logs To view a searchable log of previous instances where automations have fired, administrators can select the View Logs icon from the Automations page or within an automation at the bottom of the page. This can be helpful for troubleshooting applications that did not follow the process as expected and to determine if an automation fired/misfired based on application activity. The log will display the name of the automation, the date and time it fired, the title of the application, and the name of the actor who caused the automation to fire. Managing Automations Automation Names Automation Names should follow a predetermined format that will help you find them easily so edits can be made later. A common format is: ""The Action: Brief Summary of the Automation"" For example, if an automation is used to move an application to another review stage based on a response in a ranking form, the automation could be named: ""Move: Approved Application to Follow-Up Review"" This name allows any administrator within the site to search and modify the automation easily should any changes be made to the process in later cycles. TIP! If your automation performs multiple actions, be sure to include both actions in your Name to help you find it later. An example of this would be ""Move & Email: Application Form Completed."" NOTE: This formatting is a suggestion only with the purpose of helping with organization of your site. Automation Folders Add your automations to folders to help organize them. Once many automations have been added, it's easy to become overwhelmed when trying to locate a specific automation especially since a single automation can have multiple actions. Adding folders with names such as ""Move,"" ""Emails,"" and ""Date Activation"" can be helpful to update your process later or for troubleshooting while your program is live. To create a new folder from the Automations page: Select the Folders icon Select Create New Add a name for the Folder Select OK To add an automation to a folder from the Automations page: Select the automation Select Folders Select the folder that best describes your automation NOTE: Automations can only be associated with one folder at a time. Reviews & Assignments The set up of your review tasks and the rules to which applications are assigned should be configured before launching your program. It is important to test your review forms to ensure that scoring is reliable and consistent throughout your application process. Refer to our article Introduction to SurveyMonkey Apply: Reviews & Assignments for a collection of articles regarding the setup and completion of your review process. Testing & Troubleshooting We strongly recommend thoroughly testing your site to ensure that all aspects are working as expected. Applicants - Add test applicants through Manage Users and create an application for them within the program's Manage Applications page by selecting Create Application. You can then assume their role to complete the tasks you've created, test automations, test forms, etc., associated with your process. Reviewers - Create test reviewers to experiment with assigning test applications to reviewers and view the review forms from a reviewer's standpoint by assuming their role. Ensure that scores are calculating correctly, applicant data is appearing as expected, and that applications are moving to the appropriate stage based on a completed review, for example. Troubleshooting Automations If an automation doesn't fire when expected. Review the conditions and compare against the application you are testing to ensure the responses match. Did the activation occur? Review the WHEN TO APPLY statement and try activating the automation again using that action. Did the wrong action occur? Check your Do Statement(s) to ensure all of the actions are listed. Deleting Test Applicants and Applications When testing is complete you can permanently delete test applications to remove this data from your live applications. To permanently delete a group of applications: Select the application(s) from Manage Applications Select the More icon Select Mark as Trash Go to Trashed Applications by selecting the Applications Quick Filter and toggling to Trashed Select the application(s) to delete Select More Select Delete Permanently Confirm WARNING! This action cannot be reverted. Launching a Program If your programs are currently displayed in Grid View, to launch your program: Go to your Site Dashboard Locate the program you wish to launch At the bottom right corner of the tile, click Ready to Launch? OR At the top right corner of the tile, click on the More Options icon, then click Launch. You will be asked ""Are you sure you want to launch this program?"" Click Launch in the bottom right corner. Launch a Program in List View If your programs are currently displayed in List View, to launch your program: Go to your Site Dashboard Locate the program you wish to launch Beside the program you wish to launch, click on the More Options icon, then click Launch. You will be asked ""Are you sure you want to launch this program?"" Click Launch TIP! Before Launching your program, we would recommend testing it to ensure everything is set up correctly. When you are finished testing your program, it is recommended to archive test data and disable test accounts. Next Steps Now that your programs are built and "

Automations: “CONDITIONS”,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/automation-conditions/,"Automations: “CONDITIONS” | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What are Conditions? Explaining Matching Criteria Adding New Rules Editing or Deleting Rules Nesting Rules Help Build Automations Automations: “CONDITIONS” Apply Automations: “CONDITIONS” What are Conditions? Explaining Matching Criteria Adding New Rules Editing or Deleting Rules Nesting Rules The second component of any automation within SM Apply is the Condition which is the set of rules that determine whether the automation will fire when the activation has occurred. This article covers the basics of these rules including how to configure rules to complete your automation. What are Conditions? Conditions Conditions are the set of rules that will be validated after the activation of an automation has occurred. These rules are not required for the setup of an automation and many basic automations may bypass this entirely. An automation will not fire unless all rules listed as Conditions have been satisfied. Below is an explanation of the various parts that make up the conditions of an automation. Component Description Matching Criteria ALL: all rules listed must be met in order for the automation to fire ANY: one or more rules must be met for the automation to fire Filter This is the base of the rule and targets the question or action that is occurring. Examples: The question: ""What city were you born?"" The action: Promoted to a new stage Matching Parameters This determines what the rule is looking for when a specific answer is given. Available Parameters: - Value is exactly - Value is not - Value is one of - Value is not any of - Value contains - Value does not contain - Value has no response - Value has a response The available parameters will vary depending on the Filter selected Item The specific answer or action that must be given or must occur in order for the rule to be satisfied. The choices available here are form, task, and site-specific, and will update as changes to your site are made or new components are added. Filter example continued: Answer: Ottawa Stage Name: Application Stage ""Select a Filter"" Menu A dropdown menu is used to select the rules that the automation will validate before performing the actions stated within the DO statement. The menu is entered when the -- Select a filter -- dropdown arrow or title is selected. This menu is similar to the menu used to set the activation of your automation in that it consists of a Source menu on the left and an Event menu on the right. Explaining Matching Criteria The Matching Criteria setting is the first component of the Condition and determines when the rules are considered to be satisfied. There are two options as described earlier: ALL or ANY. ALL If the matching criteria is set to ALL, then the actions will not be performed by the automation unless all rules have been satisfied. ANY If ANY is selected, any individual rule that is satisfied will result in the actions within the DO statement to be completed. If an automation did not activate for an expected application, check the matching criteria to ensure that the correct option has been chosen. To set or edit the matching criteria of your automation simply toggle to selection as shown below. If you are editing the matching criteria of an active automation be sure to save your changes. Setting the matching criteria is all or nothing. In some cases, you may have a combination of rules where there are certain rules that must be met and a variety of others where one rule must be met. For more information on this use case, see Nesting . Adding New Rules How to Add a Rule By default, a single rule will appear available to configure when an automation is created. To configure your first rule: Set the Matching Criteria of your Condition Select the Select a filter dropdown menu Select the Task or Action group from the left-hand side of the menu Select the action, completion status, or other condition from the right-hand side of the menu. This will close the first dropdown menu. Select the Matching Parameter for the rule. This is the second dropdown menu available within the rule. Select the third dropdown and complete your rule by selecting a specific Item How to Add Additional Rules In some cases, it may be necessary to compile multiple rules for a single automation for the appropriate actions to take place. To add additional rules: Select Add Rule (plus sign) Set the filter, matching parameter, and item to complete the rule Editing or Deleting Rules How to Edit a Rule Once a rule has been added it can be edited as needed. This may be due to a change in your process, or to modify an automation that has been configured incorrectly. To edit a rule: Enter the automation where the rule exists to edit the condition Select the filter, matching parameter, or item dropdown to edit Save the automation for the changes to take affect How to Delete a Rule To delete a rule: Select Delete to remove the associated rule Save the automation for changes to take effect Deleting a rule cannot be reverted. Deleted rules can only be recovered by recreating the rule altogether. Nesting Rules Overview Once the matching criteria has been set for your Condition, all rules that have been listed are checked to ensure that either ALL of the rules are satisfied or ANY (at least one). In some cases, this may not satisfy the eligibility required for your automation. To bypass this you are given the ability to Nest rules together which ultimately groups a minimum of two rules together and allows the builder to assign the group its own matching criteria. There are two requirements in order to be able to nest: There must be at least one existing rule There must be a minimum of two rules to nest TIP! Nesting may not be necessary if the responses conditional responses needed for a specific action are choices for a single question. Make use of the matching parameters 'is one of' or 'is not one of' to state that multiple answers are acceptable under a single rule. How to Create a Nested Rule Group To nest two or more rules together: Configure at least one rule within the condition Select Add Rule to add the next rule Select Nest Rule Set the matching criteria Configure a minimum of two rules to be nested Optional: To add more than two rules within a single nested group, select the Add Rule icon associated with one of the nested rules to add another rule to the existing nested group Optional: T o add another rule that is not nested, select the Add Rule icon for any rules that do not exist within the nested group. This action will add a new rule underneath the nested group. A single condition can contain multiple nested rules. Similarly, a new nested group can be created within an existing nested group. Example of a Nested Rule To demonstrate with an example, assume an application form is a required task for one of your programs. Based on a set of responses, an automation will determine which labels will be applied to the application. Three questions are asked: What are your plans after University/College? Where were you born? Where do you currently live? If the applicant answers Travel to question 1 the label Travel will be applied to the application through this automation. However, based on the eligibility of the program, only applicants that were born in Canada or currently live in Canada should be labelled with the Travel label. Based on these conditions, the single matching criteria of ALL or ANY will not satisfy all three rules that are required. If the matching criteria was set to ALL , the applicant would need to provide ALL of the following answers: What are your plans after University/College?: Travel AND Where were you born?: Canada AND Where do you currently live?: Canada BUT, the criteria for this label only requires Canada as an answer to Question 2 OR 3. If the criteria is switched to ANY , the applicant would need to provide ANY of the following answers: What are your plans after University/College?: Travel OR Where were you born?: Canada OR Where do you currently live?: Canada This would mean that if the applicant provides any ONE of those answers, they will be given the Travel label which is incorrect since they must answer Travel to Question 1 and Canada to either Question 2 or 3. To resolve this we will be nesting two rules together and have a condition that consists of both the ALL and ANY matching criteria. This build is shown below: The breakdown for this nesting example is that the label will be applied when either of the two situations are occur with the user's responses: What are your plans after University/College?: Travel AND Where were you born?: Canada OR What are your plans after University/College?: Travel AND Where do you currently live?: Canada Related Articles July 2025 August 2025 June 2025 English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"
How to Set Up your SMTP Server,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/features/smtp-server/,"How to Set Up your SMTP Server | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Why is it Useful? How to Access the SMTP Settings How to Set Up your SMTP Server Help Features and Settings Emails How to Set Up your SMTP Server Apply How to Set Up your SMTP Server Why is it Useful? How to Access the SMTP Settings How to Set Up your SMTP Server By default, emails that are sent out from the site are sent from the SurveyMonkey Apply servers. Even if you have a Custom Sender Address these emails will be sent out through our servers. However, you have the option to configure the site to send out emails from your own servers. The following article will cover how setting up your own SMTP server can be useful and walk through the setup process within your SM Apply site. Why is it Useful? The reason setting up your own SMTP server within the site can be beneficial is because when emails are sent out from SurveyMonkey Apply they abide by the Junk/Spam and other security filters set up by the receiver of the email. Unfortunately, this can mean that if the email address is not recognized by the recipients' email domain, it can get lost in their Junk/Spam folder or be completely blocked from their inbox. However, if emails are being sent out from your own servers you have more control over the email delivery and there may be a greater chance of emails being received by users as they are more likely to recognize your email address. How to Access the SMTP Settings To access the SMTP settings within your site: Go to Settings Click on Emails Go to SMTP Settings How to Set Up your SMTP Server In order to send emails through your own servers, you will first need to connect your site to your SMTP server. Your Host, Port, Username, and Password will be provided to you within your own email settings. To set up your SMTP settings: Access your SMTP Settings Enable ""Use custom SMTP server"" Set up your Host Enter the applicable Port to match your Host Enter your Username Enter your Password Optional: Select Require TLS/SSL. This will be dependent on the Port you chose and should be accessible through your own email settings. Click Send Test Email to send an email to your Administrator Account to test the connection of your server TIP! Once your SMTP server has been set up successfully, any restrictions on the number of emails that can be sent out at a time will need to be configured within your server settings. We would recommend contacting your IT representative responsible for your email server in order to ensure your SMTP server settings are set up correctly.

Some benefits of having your own unique phone line are: Increased security ensuring that only the customer’s organization can send SMS surveys using the unique line Improved deliverability as an individual toll free number is subjected to less scrutiny from cellular carriers Higher response rates as respondents will be more likely to know who they’re receiving the survey from, as it’s your organization's unique number. It isn’t permitted to use the Text message collector for political, financial, or gambling-related use cases. For additional info, please see Twilio’s Forbidden message categories and unsupported use cases . To set up your unique phone number to send text message surveys: Contact your Customer success manager (CSM) and let them know you’re interested. If you’re not an Enterprise customer yet, contact sales . They’ll respond with a survey where you can supply information about your text messaging use case, including proof of your opt-in process. SurveyMonkey works with our SMS vendor, Twilio, to authorize your usage. This can take up to 2-3 weeks. SurveyMonkey provides you with a dedicated phone number for your region to start sending text message surveys. Opt-in Process In our setup form, we ask for details on your text message opt-in process. In order to gain approval from our SMS provider, we’ll need to verify where and how you get buy-in from your respondents to receive messages from your organization. This is required in order to send text messages via SurveyMonkey. Check out our SMS provider’s tips on appropriate Opt-in methods .

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is available in English only. If you use our SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration, you can set up a survey that gets sent to customers after someone closes a case in Salesforce. Learn more about the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration . Automate your survey distribution to collect timely customer feedback and take action. You can use the Salesforce integration to send CSAT surveys after a customer interacts with your support team. We'll use a CSAT survey in this example, but case closed workflows can work with other kinds of surveys, like Customer Effort Score (CES) or Net Promoter Score (NPS). Create Your Survey Create the survey you want to send when someone closes a case. Keep the following in mind: Start with a rating question, such as a Multiple Choice, Rating, or NPS question. To create a CSAT question, use a Multiple Choice or Matrix/Rating Scale question type with a 5-point scale. If you use a Multiple Choice question, enable scoring . If you use a Matrix/Rating Scale question, add weights to the answer choices . It's best to use 3-4 questions in your survey. (Optional) Create Custom Objects and Fields in Salesforce You can create a custom object in Salesforce to hold your survey responses. If you’re using our managed package or already have an object set up, skip this step. When creating your custom object: Custom objects typically have a lookup relationship with a standard object. Lookup relationships are like a parent/child relationship between your custom survey object and any other standard or custom object in Salesforce. For example, you can create a lookup relationship between the custom CSAT Survey object and the Case object. Create a custom field for each survey answer you’ll map to the object. For example: Create a number field to hold the CSAT score. Create a text field to hold an open-text answer. Create a text field to hold the label for your CSAT question. Set Up Salesforce Survey Mappings In SurveyMonkey, create survey mappings to push responses to your custom Salesforce object. You can either: Use our managed package , which creates an object and mappings for you. Create your own mappings to a custom object. To set up mappings: Open the Salesforce integration. Connect your survey to your Salesforce environment if you haven't already. Create your mappings. Learn more about creating mappings Once you save your mappings and send your survey, we push any new survey responses to the Salesforce object you chose. Add Custom Variables to Your Survey Add the Case ID variable to your survey link to relate survey responses with the case. You can also add custom variables for other data you want to track. Learn how to add custom variables to your survey link . Design an Email Template in Salesforce Your case closed email is the main piece of the Salesforce flow . When your support agent closes a case, the flow sends the survey to the case contact. There are a few ways to send a survey over email: Include your survey link in the body of a Salesforce email template in your outbound message. Create a SurveyMonkey Email Invitation and send your survey through Salesforce. Create a Case Closed Flow in Salesforce Once you create your email template in Salesforce, you can build the Salesforce flow. Use your outbound message in the flow to trigger your survey. Learn more about creating flows in Salesforce . Set Conditions for your Case Closed Survey If you send surveys after every case is closed, your customers may experience survey fatigue and stop responding to surveys. You can use conditions in your Salesforce flow to limit how often you send surveys. For example, you can send the survey in the following conditions: Only for a certain number of cases (Example: every 6th case closed). Only after a period of time (Example: if the survey taker hasn't submitted a response in 7 days). Only for Certain Number of Cases You might want to trigger a survey for a certain number of cases only (Ex: every 4th case). To do this, you'll need to use formulas and workflow rules in Salesforce. Add an auto-number field to the Case object to assign each case a numeric value. To do this, add an auto-number field to the Case object. This field assigns each case a numeric value of {0}. Adding an auto-number field assigns a whole number to each case. Use a Salesforce MOD formula to return the case number to 0 whenever it is divisible by 10. The end result will be a revolving set of numbers from 1-10 that resets to 0 whenever the case number hits 10. The screenshot below shows a formula set up for our environment. The Survey_Send_Number__C field is the auto-number field we set up earlier. The 6 is the number to divide by. In this case, every 6th case will receive a survey. Create a flow with a condition that sends the survey when that MOD formula equals 0 (which will only happen every 6th case). This will be our workflow rule criteria. Only After Certain Time Periods You can limit how often surveys are sent to individual respondents to only send a survey after someone hasn’t completed a survey for a certain time period. To do this, use custom mappings to map the Response Created Date or Response Modified Date attribute to Salesforce. The Completion Time attribute tells Salesforce when your recipient last completed a survey. Then, create a trigger in Salesforce to check the Completion Time before sending a survey. To only send surveys after a certain time period: In Salesforce, create a date field on the Contact object. In SurveyMonkey, go to the Salesforce integration. Create a custom mapping to map Response Create or Response Modified to the date field on the Contact object. In Salesforce, create a trigger to distribute the survey based on these rules. The trigger needs to do 3 actions: Check the date on the contact for the case in question If the date is more than a certain time period (ex: 7 days) before the current date, send the survey. Otherwise, do nothing. If there is no date at all, send the survey.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is available in English only. If you use our SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration, you can use your survey data to report on trends in Salesforce. Learn more about the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration . Once you've mapped your survey to Salesforce , you can build custom reports and dashboards for the responses you’ve captured in Salesforce. Using Salesforce Dashboards There are many ways to report on survey response data within Salesforce. Once you’ve created reports, you can create Salesforce Dashboards based on those reports. You can edit, delete, and add new Reports and Dashboards within Salesforce as needed. Example : You want to create a dashboard for case closed surveys. You may want to plot a dashboard by agent, ticket type, and case reason. This can help you analyze NPS and CSAT scores across different variables in Salesforce. Applying Formulas to Data You can also use formula fields to categorize your data in reports. For example, if you map Net Promoter® Score (NPS) to Salesforce, you can create a formula to categorize scores as promoter, passive, or detractor. To do this: Add a formula field to the object you map NPS data to. Create a formula that categorizes the NPS scores: Score of 9 or 10 is categorized as Promoter Score of 7 or 8 is categorized as Passive Score of 6 or less is categorized as Detractor Learn more about tracking NPS in Salesforce . Or, use our sample formula to group NPS responses. The custom formula field on your object will translate the numerical score into a NPS category. You can then use the NPS data to create custom reports or dashboards that group responses by Promoter, Detractor, or Passive categories. SurveyMonkey Support can’t consult on coding issues. Reach out to your Salesforce administrator for help implementing these features. These examples help you get started with our Salesforce integration and you may need to make changes for your organization Learn more : Measuring Net Promoter® Score with the Salesforce Integration Measuring Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) with the Salesforce Integration Using SurveyMonkey Views and Dashboards There are a few ways to analyze and share your results in SurveyMonkey: Use filters and compare rules to drill into your data and understand how different variables affected your survey results. Create views that keep your filters and compare rules applied/ For example, you can filter a case closed survey by different locales, then save views for each locale. Set up custom dashboards to share results with stakeholders. Customize the charts on your dashboard to share the most useful data with your colleagues. Example : Based on an age demographic question, you want to view how survey takers age 25+ impacted the results. Use compare rules to show the difference between 2 age groups. The charts will be split into each of those 2 age groups, so you can see how anyone over the age of 25 impacted the survey compared to anyone below the age of 25, all in one nice view Related Articles Export Responses to a Google Sheet Export Responses to Microsoft Excel SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Web Link Encryption English Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

Indexing your Form Fields for Calculations,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/advanced/indexing-fields/,"Indexing your Form Fields for Calculations | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Set Up your Question Variable Question Identifier Index Indexing a Single Column Question Indexing a Single Cell Index an Entire Column Index a Range of Cells Indexing a Multi-Column Question Index a Single Cell Index the Entire Column Index the Entire Row Index a Range of Cells Indexing the Score of a Question Help Advanced Features Indexing your Form Fields for Calculations Apply Indexing your Form Fields for Calculations How to Set Up your Question Variable Question Identifier Index Indexing a Single Column Question Indexing a Single Cell Index an Entire Column Index a Range of Cells Indexing a Multi-Column Question Index a Single Cell Index the Entire Column Index the Entire Row Index a Range of Cells Indexing the Score of a Question Grid Indexing is the process of referring to a specific cell within a grid in order to use that value in your Advanced Expression Piping formula. This article will walk through how SurveyMonkey Apply will index the cell within the grid or column. This indexing will be used through the rest of the How To articles for the AEP functions. How to Set Up your Question Variable When setting up your advanced expression piping variable you will need to set up the Reference to the question that you are looking to use in the formula. A question variable consists of two parts: The Identifier of the Question + The Index to the specific cell(s)/row/column of that question Where the format of the question variable could be either: identifier[index] identifier.index Question Identifier A question identifier is used to target a specific question within a form and is required for AEP. Question identifiers within a single form must be unique in order for the expression to reference the intended cell successfully. Index The index will always be a numerical value to determine the placement of the cell/row/column within the question. Indexing will always begin at 0 for the first cell, in the first row and column. Question 1 (q1) Column 1 Row 1 [0] (Start here!) Row 2 [1] Row 3 [2] Indexing a Single Column Question If you have set up a Single Column Question the questions numerical index will increment from top to bottom. There are three index options available to you with single-column grid questions: Indexing a Single Cell In some cases, you may wish to reference a single cell in your table. For example, you only want to pull the response given in row 3. Below is an illustration of the Index: Question 1 (q1) Column 1 Row 1 [0] Row 2 [1] Row 3 [2] Again, the index always begins with [0] where the index of Row 1/ Column 1 = [0], Row 2/ Column 1 = [1], etc. Therefore, to reference the single cell in Row 3 , our question variable will be q1[2] . Index an Entire Column Since there is only one column in this question. If you wish to total the entire question, you can just use the identifier, and this will automatically include all cells within the question. Index a Range of Cells In some cases, you may want to index more than just one cell, but not an entire column. Therefore, we allow the ability to index a range of cells at once. In order to index a range our question variable will be: identifier[Lower:Upper] TIP! The lower value (first value) is inclusive, therefore this is where the range will start. However, the upper value (second value) is exclusive , therefore the range will end with the cell prior. Question 1 (q1) Column 1 Row 1 [0] Row 2 [1] Row 3 [2] Using the example above: To index Row 1 and Row 2: q1[0:2] To index Row 2 and Row 3: q1[1:3] Since the lower value is exclusive , we reference the last cell [2] + 1 = [3] to ensure all cells including the final cell is included in the range. If the index stated q1[1:2], the final cell placed at row 3 column 2 would not have been included in the range. Indexing a Multi-Column Question Indexing in a Multi-Column Question, is slightly different than a Single Column question , in that the index values increment from Left to Right, Top to Bottom . This section will walk through how to set up your indexing if using a Multi-Column question . Index a Single Cell In some cases, you may wish to reference a single cell in your table for example you only want to pull the response given in Row 1/ Column 2. As mentioned previously, the indexing will always be a numerical value beginning at 0. Below is an illustration of the Index: Question 2 (q2) Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Row 1 [0] [1] [2] Row 2 [3] [4] [5] Where the index of Row 1/ Column 1 = [0], Row 1/ Column 2 = [1], Row 2/Column 3 = [3] etc. Therefore, if we want to reference the single cell in Row 1/ Column 2 , our Question Variable will be q2[1] . If we want to reference a single cell in Row 2/ Column 3 , our Question Variable would be q2[5] . Index the Entire Column If we want to reference all values in a column, for example to find the SUM of the column, we can do so by simply indexing the column. The format for this is slightly different than a single cell and is formatted as: identifier[:columnindex] The colon ("":"") before the index in this case states that we are referencing the whole column. Again, the index will begin at [0]. This is very similar to Single-Column grids, however now we have multiple columns to reference from. Question 2 (q2) Column 1 [:0] Column 2 [:1] Column 3 [:2] Row 1 Row 2 Therefore, if we want to reference the entire Column 2 , our Question Variable will be q2[:1] . Index the Entire Row If we want to reference the values in a row, for example find the Average of the row, we can do so by indexing the row. The format for this is slightly different than a single cell and the column reference: identifier[rowindex:] The colon ("":"") after the index in this case states that we are referencing the whole row. Again, the index will begin at [0]. Question 2 (q2) Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Row 1 [0:] Row 2 [1:] Therefore, if we want to reference the entire Row 2 , our Question Variable will be q2[1:] Index a Range of Cells In some cases, you may want to index more than just one cell, but not the entire table. Therefore, we allow the ability to index a range of cells at once. In order to index a range our question variable will be: identifier[Lower:Upper] The Lower value is inclusive therefore this is where the range will start, however the Upper value is exclusive, therefore the range will end with the cell prior. Question 2 (q2) Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Row 1 [0] [1] [2] Row 2 [3] [4] [5] For this example, if we want to index Row 1/ Column 1 to Row 2/ Column 2 , our question variable would be q2[0:5] If we wish to index Row 1/Column 2 to Row 2/ Column 3 , our question variable will be q2[1:6]. Indexing for a multi-column grid goes from left to right, top to bottom, it is only possible to index a range by cells. You will not be able to only index a range within a single column. For example, if there are 3 rows, you cannot index only Row 1/Column 2 and Row 2/Column 2 using range indexing. Indexing the Score of a Question Within ranking forms , you are able to add point values to form choices that are allocated to the total score of the application when the reviewer makes the selection. In the case that we need to later reference the score given to a particular question we can do so by using the following format: identifier.score The identifier will vary depending on the question that is selected and "".score"" signals that we are trying to extract the score from that specific question. Consider an example where 2 multiple choice questions have custom scores allocated to each choice within the question. These questions have been labelled with the identifiers q3 and q4 respectively. We can extract the scores given to the final review score of the application using the question variables: q3.score q4.score This can come in extremely handy in the case where you are looking to pull the SUM or Average (AVG) of reviewer questions within a single form, or if you would like to display and/or report on scores from specific sections of a review form.

Mapping Form Fields to Campaign Monitor Default Fields Campaign Monitor subscriber lists have 2 default fields that will appear in the mapping window: Email: The email address of the subscriber (required) Name: The name of the subscriber (optional) Custom Fields You can also map your form’s fields to any Custom fields you are using in Campaign Manager. Custom fields can store additional contact information such as a subscriber’s address, city, country, phone number or other relevant data such as interests, birthdays or answers to a survey. Campaign Monitor Custom Fields may be no greater than 250 characters in length. We suggest you match them up to Wufoo single line text fields because they have a 255 character limit. Wufoo Multiple Choice, Dropdowns and Checkboxes choices must match their Campaign Monitor counterparts. This means, for example, that a Radio Field on the Wufoo side must have all the same options as the Multi-Value Custom Field field in Campaign Monitor and a custom field that accepts predetermined values, for example, Country or US States, should only accept those same values on the matching Wufoo field. An integration submitted with a mismatch of these options will result in empty values in your Campaign Monitor custom field. Integration Errors We'll send you an automated email you if we notice any errors with the integration. Error Description 204 Email Address exists in Suppression List If you’ve previously suppressed this address you can’t resubmit it through the API until you remove it from the suppression list.

Explaining Automation Advanced Settings The advanced settings within an automation are available and optional. If advanced settings are not used, automations will fire immediately and infinitely. Setting Function Limit Set the limit for the maximum number of times this trigger will fire within the site. This is not per application . If you set the limit to 1, this trigger will only ever fire once within the site and not once per application. Priority When you select Control when this automation will run : Set a priority for the automation so that if another automation fires off of the same activation, one of the automations will always fire before or after the other. The higher the number, the higher the Priority. If priority is used, it should be enabled and set for all automations using that same activation. Delay When you select Control when this automation will run : Enable to delay the action from occurring when the activation and rules have been satisfied. Hours and Days are available as intervals to create the delay. Once the delay expires, the actions will be performed. You can also select to check the conditions again after the delay has occurred, to ensure the conditions are still met when the action occurs. How to Enable Advanced Settings Enable Advanced Settings for a New Automation Advanced settings are enabled while editing an automation.

How to Import your Historical Data,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/faqs/importing-data/,"How to Import your Historical Data | Apply Help Log in Apply Help FAQs and Troubleshooting Troubleshooting Guides How to Import your Historical Data Apply How to Import your Historical Data The SurveyMonkey Apply team offers a service that allows you to import your historical data into your Apply site. Once your programs and sites have been set up, we'll provide you with a template to populate with your historical data. When your data is ready, we'll review your requirements, validate your data, and then import it. Below you’ll find details outlining the requirements and options for populating the template we provide if you wish to import your historical data. If you have any questions about importing your data or are interested in requesting this service, reach out to your Account Executive or submit a request to be contacted . Import template Primary Columns E-Mail (required) - Refers to the email address of the application owner. First Name (required) - First name of the application owner Last Name (required) - Last name of the application owner Organization Name (required) - If the application is associated with an organization, the name of the organization must be provided here. Organization ID (required) - If the application is associated with an organization that already exists on your SurveyMonkey Apply site, the organization ID must be provided so that we can uniquely identify which organization to assign the application to. If the organization does not exist on your site and you wish to add the organization as part of your import, include the text ‘New’ in this column to create the organization and assign the application to it. Multiple Applications ID - This is a string of numbers and/or letters that will uniquely identify the application within your program. You can specify the ID during the import or the system will automatically assign one if none are provided. If you intend to update the data of existing applications for your program, the unique ID of the application must be specified otherwise a new application will be created for the applicant. Application State (required) - This defines how the system should handle the application once imported. Options include: Normal : The application will be visible to applicants Locked : The application is visible to applicants but no further edits can be made by the applicant. Hidden : The application is only visible to administrators. Archived : The application is no longer visible to applicants and the application is separated from all active program applications. Administrators will still have the opportunity to unarchive or move archived applications to the “Trash”. Deleted : The application will reside in the “Trash” where it can either be deleted permanently or restored as an active application. <Form Response> - A column for each form question response will be included in the import from your program applications. Include the appropriate response in each column. Additional Columns Template Column Description Application Title A title can be assigned to each application Application Stage* Once your program is built, you can define which stage within the program workflow the application should be assigned to. If no stage is specified, the import will default to the first application stage. Application Status* These are custom statuses you can use to communicate to your applicants where their applications are at within your workflow. Your program must have statuses configured in order to include them with your import. Applications can only have one status at a time. Application Labels Labels allow you to tag applications for internal purposes. Applications can have multiple labels at any given time. <Custom Fields> If your site includes custom fields attributed to the application, you will have the option to include the data you’d like to populate with your import. <File Attachments> A column for each file you’d like to attach to an “Attach File” task within your program workflow can be included with the import. Within the column, you’ll be required to provide the path to the file from the ZIP file you will provide the SurveyMonkey team along with your template file. More details on file attachments below. For the purposes of the import, the ID for the given element within your program must be used in place of the name you have assigned it. For example, the first stage in your program is labelled “Application Stage” but the ID “112279” is what must be included in the import file. All IDs will be provided with your template file. File Attachments Warnings Fatal Errors These are the warnings that will prevent the rest of the file being validated: Invalid csv file or encoding detected. Please check the csv that was uploaded and make sure it is not an xls. - Invalid file type uploaded, only csvs are accepted - An undetectable or unknown encoding Our supported encodings are: ""Latin-1"", ""UTF-8"", ""UTF-16"", ""CP-1252"". Use a tool like Excel or Google Sheets to export to a supported encoding. This row is of a different length than the header row. There's an issue with the CSV's format. We found a row longer or shorter than the header row. We use the most common configurations of `,` as separators and `""` as delimiters. The file will need to be fixed. If it's being exported from Excel and seems fine in Excel then check the export formats and make sure it's using commas and double quotes. If this import has files you must also supply the .zip! This import has file columns but a zip was not provided Provide the zip when validating Uploaded data csv's columns do not match those from the template. There were modifications to the headers values on our identifiers. Anything at the end in (). Correct the changed headers and then re-validate. Sometimes we're provided with very large zip files. There's no size limit, however, there is an upload time limit of 10 minutes. If the zip takes longer than 10 minutes to upload then it will not allow for validation to continue as we can't get the zip. In these cases, please contact us to assist in getting the files validated. Other Warnings These are the warnings that should report out altogether. If you run into a case where one of these causes the rest of validation to stop please create a bug ticket with all necessary reproduction files and steps. Warnings will include the row number they are for. ""%(SomeName)s"" indicate a placeholder that will change depending on the actual values that were part of the validation warning Message Caused By Possible Solutions Found a blank value in required column 'Multiple Applications ID (usid:frcid)'. When the 'Multiple Applications ID' column is present it is a required field and it must contain a non-blank unique value. Enter a unique value into the cell Found a duplicate value in the Multiple Applications ID column. The duplicate value was: %(Duplicate Value)s A non-unique value was entered into the 'Multiple Applications ID' column. This means a prior row already had that value in the column Enter a unique value into the cell There are multiple entries for user: %(User Email)s For imports that do not allow for multiple applications per applicant this warning will appear if there are multiple rows for the same e-mail. The solutions depend on the case.If the import is meant to allow for multiple applications per applicant and the option was not chosen when the template was created, you can generate a new template with the appropriate options and transfer the data.Otherwise, solutions in the past have been fake unique e-mail or something like if the e-mail was 'jane@some-email.com' to make them unique by add something like 'jane +2 @some-email.com'. There are multiple entries for user with email: %(User Email)s See above See above Invalid status '%(Cell Value)s' in 'Application Status' column. An invalid value in the data for the Application Status column Verify the data is correct for this column. Value '%(Cell Value)s' is not a valid date format. An invalid date format in the data for a date type column. (Typically a form response to a date question) Make sure there's a valid date in the cell. Be wary of excel performing strange operations on date cells. If it looks like it's a valid date and still will not parse open up the csv in something like Notepad and verify that the tool creating the csv isn't modifying the value behind the scenes. Question: %(Question Name)s for form %(Form Name)s is not a multiple choice question. When the template was generated the question referenced was a multiple choice question, but it is no longer. Form and site modifications should be avoided from the time a template is generated to when the data is in the system. Regenerate a new template. Response '%(Cell Value)s' is not a valid choice for the question '%(Question Name)s' in the form '%(Form Name)s' The value in the cell does not match up to an actual choice for the question it is for. (Single choice/Multi choice) We require a 1 to 1 value match. i.e. `ON` is not equal to `Ontario` if it says `Ontario` in the form it must be `Ontario` in the csv Question: %(Question Name)s for form %(Form Name)s is not a single choice question. When the template was generated the question referenced was a single choice question, but it is no longer. Form and site modifications should be avoided from the time a template is generated to when the data is in the system. Regenerate a new template. Missing value for column 'State' The State column is a required column. Add a proper value for State. Invalid State '%(Cell Value)s' in 'State' column A State was provided but not a valid one. Correct the value so it matches a proper State Missing user information in one of 'E-mail', 'First Name' or 'Last Name' columns at row %(Row Number)s The columns E-mail, First Name and Last Name are required columns. Add values to the cells Missing submission title The Title column is also a required column Add a value to the Title column Missing organization name When including organizations the name is a required column if the Organization ID column is set to 'new'. Add a value to the Organization Name column Invalid organization ID '%(Cell Value)s' When including organizations the Organization ID column must either be 'new' and used in conjunction with Organization Name or must be a valid ID. Set the value accordingly. The file '%(Cell Value)s' does not exist in the zip archive provided. The file path specified in the cell cannot be found in the provided Zip Check that the file exists in the ZIP. If it does then verify that the value in the cell doesn't contain typos.

How to Hide/Show Tasks,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/hide-show-task/,"How to Hide/Show Tasks | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Hide/Show a Task Manually How to Hide a Task How to Show a Task How to Hide/Show Using Automations Show a Task Hide a Task Hide and Show Two Tasks Help Build Tasks How to Hide/Show Tasks Apply How to Hide/Show Tasks How to Hide/Show a Task Manually How to Hide a Task How to Show a Task How to Hide/Show Using Automations Show a Task Hide a Task Hide and Show Two Tasks Within SurveyMonkey Apply, you can choose to hide or show tasks from certain applicants. You can do so manually for a specific applicant, or automatically if an applicant meets set conditions. This article will walk through how to Hide and Show tasks from applicants within the site. How to Hide/Show a Task Manually Due to special circumstances, you may need to hide or show a task within an individual application. For example, for specific reasons, you do not require an applicant to complete one of your tasks and wish for them to proceed with the application without completion of the task. In this case, you would simply Hide the task for that submission, making the task no longer required. How to Hide a Task How to Show a Task How to Hide a Task In order to hide a task within an application: Go to the Admin Application View Go to the Application Tab Click on the More Options icon beside the task you wish to Hide Select Hide task from the applicant You will be asked, ""Are you sure that you want to hide this task from the applicant?"" Click Yes How to Show a Task In order to show a task within an application: Go to the Admin Application View Go to the Application Tab Click on the More Options icon beside the task you wish to Show Select Show task to the applicant You will be asked, ""Are you sure that you want to show this task to the applicant?"" Click Yes How to Hide/Show Using Automations Show a Task Hide a Task Hide and Show Two Tasks If you wish to Hide or Show tasks on a more consistent basis, you can set up automations to perform this action. For example, depending on an applicants response to a question we may or may not require that they request a recommendation through the site. This example will walk through how to correctly Hide and Show the task based on the applicant's response. We use 2 automations complete this process in case the applicant should re-enter the application form and change their response. Additionally, we would also recommend setting up prerequisites on the task and hiding the task until the prerequisites are met: Go to your Task settings of the task being hidden/shown Click to ""Enable prerequisites for this task"" Select the task used for the activation as the prerequisite Enable ""Hide task until prerequisites are met"" This will ensure that the task will be hidden until the applicant has completed the form and selected the correct response to the question. Show a Task WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Task Task has been completed Application Form CONDITIONS Conditions to match: ALL Application Form: Do you volunteer for any charities/ organizations is exactly Yes DO Action Source Action Application Task Show a Task Task: Recommendation from Volunteer Coordinator Hide a Task WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Application Task Task has been completed Application Form CONDITIONS Conditions to match: ALL Application Form: Do you volunteer for any charities/ organizations is exactly No DO Action Source Action Application Task Show a Task Task Recommendation from Volunteer Coordinator Hide and Show Two Tasks If you have a case where two tasks are mutually exclusive from each other you can set up two automations similar to above, to hide and show the two applicable tasks. NOTE: For this example, we refer to the use of the Verify Charity Status task, where we have one task to verify Canadian charities, and another to verify US charities.

How to Add and Manage Files,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/features/add-manage-files/,"How to Add and Manage Files | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article What are Files? How to Add a File Making a File Accessible to Users How to Edit a File How to Delete a File File Settings How to Download Uploaded Files Help Features and Settings Pages and Files How to Add and Manage Files Apply How to Add and Manage Files What are Files? How to Add a File Making a File Accessible to Users How to Edit a File How to Delete a File File Settings How to Download Uploaded Files Files can be added as informational resources for users within your site. The access of these files can be controlled to specific roles and managed from a single area. This article explains how to add and edit files for the reference of users within your site. What are Files? Files can be uploaded to provide access to templates and other resources to users within your site. Some examples of files uploaded for applicants and reviewers are: Program Information External resource files Templates (budget, essay, etc.) Score sheets/rubrics Ranking reports Once files are added to your site a link will be generated so that a link to the resource can be created. This link can be used to create a hyperlink to display to users that when selected will begin downloading the file for the user selecting the link. To navigate to the Files page: Select the Settings icon Select Files How to Add a File To add a file: Select the Settings icon Select Files Select the Upload File icon Select the file(s) from your computer's file manager Wait for the files to complete their upload Once the file is added a unique link will be created which can then be used to create a link to the resource to provide access to the file. To copy the location of a file: Select the More Options icon Select Copy URL Making a File Accessible to Users Access to files is only available when a link has been provided to a user. This can be given as a link through a program or task description, given through email, or other means. Instead of presenting the full link of the file, you can create a hyperlink that will download the file when selected by a user. We reference this as a link to the resource. To create this link to a resource: Copy the file URL Highlight the text you wish to turn into a hyperlink. Select the Link icon from the formatting bar. Paste the file URL into the URL field Select OK See our article How to Link to Pages and Files for details on customizing hyperlinks within your site. How to Edit a File A file can be edited at any point in time. File attributes that can be edited are the title and access. To edit a file: From the Files page, select the More options icon for the file you wish to edit Click Edit Update the title or the file's access (hidden/visible) Select Save How to Delete a File Deleting a file will remove the ability for any user to access it within the site. To delete a file: From the Files page , select the More Options icon Click Delete Confirm the deletion To delete multiple files: Select the checkboxes of the files you wish to delete Select Actions Click Delete Once a file is deleted it cannot be retrieved. File Settings When adding a new file the visibility of that file will be set to visible by default. As expected, visibility determines whether members within the site will have access to the file when it is cited throughout your site. There are two options when setting this access: Visible or Hidden. Visible Files Accessible if a link to the file has been provided to your users Hidden files Will not be accessible even when the direct link has been provided to the file NOTE: Files can only be accessed by applicants, reviewers, and recommenders if they have been given the link directly or if a link to the file has been created. See Explaining the Visibility of Pages & Files for more information. How to Download Uploaded Files Once a file has been added to your site a link will need to be created to present the file to your users. When the link is selected the file will begin downloading to the user's computer for viewing. Administrators will always have access to files that have been added through the Files page. To download a file as an administrator: Go to Files Select the More Options icon of the file you wish to download Select Download If a link to the resource is not created, the file will not be accessible to any visitors to your site.

To hide data in the report by default, but allow people to expand the fields shown in report or export all data, turn on (check) the Allow User to View Columns Not Checked setting. Why can't I print my report? At this time, due to technical limitations on our end, you can't really print a report from your browser or save it as nice-looking PDF—the Datagrid widget won't display in full and Graph widgets are not included. We're sorry for the inconvenience! You'll need to export your data as outlined above and use Excel, Google Sheets, or another software to make a printable report. Or you can take screenshots of your report. Can I use the API or other integrations to export? You can export data from your Wufoo account into another site using one of our integrations .

Build Surveys with AI,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/build-with-ai/,"Build Surveys with AI | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Feature Availability and Settings Creating with Build with AI Your Survey Content Mobile App Experience Help Creating Surveys Designing Your Survey Build Surveys with AI SurveyMonkey Build Surveys with AI Feature Availability and Settings Creating with Build with AI Your Survey Content Mobile App Experience Build with AI, powered by the Azure OpenAI service and OpenAI, makes it easy and quick to create a survey. To create a survey, type a prompt that includes your survey goals but excludes sensitive information. With a click of a button, we'll generate a survey for you. You can choose to use it and edit it, re-generate a new survey with an edited prompt, or start over with another survey creation method . How Your Data is Processed Build with AI uses the Azure Open AI service and Open AI to generate your survey. Your data isn't used to train Azure Open AI service and Open AI models. Learn how this feature processes your data . Avoid including any sensitive information in your prompts—you are responsible for the information you enter into Build with AI. Please note that the Azure OpenAI service and OpenAI does not use prompts in connection with Build with AI to train Azure OpenAI service and OpenAI models or improve OpenAI’s service offering. Feature Availability and Settings Build with AI is only available to some customers in the following supported regions . Feature availability depends on your plan: Basic and Individual plans : Build with AI is available for all accounts. Teams and Enterprise plans : For most accounts, your Primary Admin determines whether your team can access Build with AI . For details on the terms that apply to the use of this feature, please see our Self-Serve AI Service-Specific Terms and SurveyMonkey Enterprise Service-Specific Terms . HIPAA and Enhanced Sensitive Data Protection : Build with AI isn’t available to HIPAA-enabled accounts, or those with the Enhanced Sensitive Data Protection feature enabled.

Build a Survey with AI To create a survey with Build with AI: Select Create Survey . Select Build with AI . Enter a prompt. We recommend using one of the examples as a template, but you can also write your own prompt from scratch. If you use the SurveyMonkey app, you can choose to use voice commands or type your survey prompt. Submit the prompt to generate a survey. Preview your survey. If you want to use it, select Continue to edit and customize the survey. Otherwise, you can Try another prompt or start over with another survey creation method .

Certain survey use cases are not permitted—for details, please see SurveyMonkey's Acceptable Uses Policy , as well as additional third party provider usage policies , and acceptable use and conduct policies. How to Write a Prompt to Generate a Survey State your goal (e.g. we want to improve the employee experience). Describe what you want to know (e.g. we need to survey our employees about pay, benefits, hours, workload, and culture). Provide general context describing who is sending the survey (e.g. we're a large sporting goods manufacturer). Specify what demographic or company information you want to know about your respondents (e.g. business industry and size, or age and gender). Be specific and as detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, or style. Be precise—avoid ambiguity or vagueness. Iterate on your prompt until you get a survey draft you can work with. If your prompt contains unsafe content, you may receive an error or be unable to create an AI generated survey for up to an hour. You can create a survey in another way or wait to retry Build with AI with an edited prompt. Mobile App Experience When using Build with AI in the SurveyMonkey app, you can use voice commands to create your survey prompt rather than typing it out. The app uses native OS speech-to-text to capture your voice prompts. Voice prompts are not stored in SurveyMonkey – only the prompt’s text output is stored. Once survey questions are proposed on the preview page, you can Continue to edit and customize your survey. Or, select Try another prompt to revise your prompt.

Get a Recommendation Task,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/recommendation/,"Get a Recommendation Task | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Create a Get a Recommendation Task Task Settings What Happens Next? Quick Reference Help Build Tasks Get a Recommendation Task Apply Get a Recommendation Task How to Create a Get a Recommendation Task Task Settings What Happens Next? Quick Reference The ""Get a Recommendation"" task is useful when applicants are required to provide a reference or multiple references in support of their application. NOTE: For information in regards to assisting Applicants and Recommenders with issues in this process you can refer to our Applicant FAQ and Recommender FAQ . How to Create a Get a Recommendation Task In order to create a Get a Recommendation Task in your site: Go to your Workflow Click on the Name of the stage to access the stage configurations. Click on the Tasks tab. Click on the + icon Select Get a Recommendation Complete the task settings as listed below. Task Settings Settings Description Title This is the name of the task that will be visible to your applicants within their task list. Recommendation Format Choose the accepted format for the recommendation: - Fill out a Form - Attach a File If you select Fill out a Form you will have the option to create a new form or select a form that already exists in your site. You can then edit the form within the form builder based on the information you require from the recommender. If you select Attach a File this will allow the recommender to attach a file as a recommendation. TIP! Select both formats to either give the recommender the choice of the formats type they wish to complete, or to force them to complete both formats. Allow Multiple Recommendations Select this option when multiple recommendations are required. - Set the minimum number of recommendations required - Set the maximum number of recommendations required --OR-- Select No Limit Limit requests to specific email domains Restrict email invitations to a specific email domain. For example, a use case could be if a program for research funding is being run internally in a school and students need a recommendation from a professor of the school. Setting the domain to be limited to @myschool.edu will ensure that only emails to that school are sent. Allow Applicants to see Completed Recommendations Enable this if you wish for your applicants to be able to see what their recommenders have to say about them. If this is NOT enabled they will not be able to see the completed recommendations. Allow Recommenders to see Applications Allow your recommenders to be able to view the application of the applicant they are submitting a recommendation for. Description This description is shown to applicants who complete this task. Specifying a description is optional. When checked, the Visual Editor is displayed which allows the content to be formatted accordingly. This description will be visible to your applicants within the application underneath the task. Optional Make your task Optional. By default, your task will be required to complete. If you wish to allow your applicants to proceed without completing the task you can set the task to be optional. Deadline Set a deadline on your task. Decide if you wish to prevent applicants from completing the task after a certain date. Prevent Editing Enabling this setting will mean that applicants will not be able to edit the task once they have fully completed it. Prerequisites The tasks you set as Prerequisites will need to be completed in the site before this task becomes available. A common example of this is if you wish to force your applicants to complete a Basic Information form task before this task becomes available. TIP! Select ""Hide task until prerequisites are met"" if you wish to make it clear to your applicants that they need to complete the prerequisite first. What Happens Next? There are three major components to the Get a Recommendation task: 1. Applicant Completes the Request The Applicant fills in the details of the Recommender including the First Name, Last Name, Email, and a brief message (optional) to send the recommender. 2. The Recommender Completes the Recommendation The Recommender receives an email with an invite to complete the recommendation. This will allow the recommender to login to the site. Upon logging in they will be able to see the application in their recommender panel. When they click Start they will be asked if they wish to Accept or Decline the recommendation request from the applicant. Upon Accepting, the recommender will be able to complete and submit the recommendation for the applicant within the site. The decision to Accept or Decline will be displayed to the applicant within their application. However, based on the Notification settings the applicant can also be notified when the recommender completes their application. 3. The Applicant must confirm that the Recommendation has been received. Once the recommender has completed their recommendation, it will be marked as complete to the recommender. However, on the applicant's side, within their application, the task will remain In Progress, until the applicant confirms that they have received the recommendation and clicks Submit. Quick Reference Quick Reference allows recommenders to submit recommendations without logging into a SurveyMonkey Apply account. They will instead use a secure, one-time link sent to their email to provide their recommendation. You can enable Quick Reference individually for each task. How do I enable it? To enable Quick Reference for a task: Access the settings of your Recommendation Task. Check the box to Enable quick references . Once you enable Quick Reference, your recommenders will start receiving secure, one-time-use links to provide their recommendations.

Notifications,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/features/notifications/,"Notifications | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Site Notifications: Overview How to Access Site Notifications Applicant Notifications Reviewer Notifications Recommender Notifications Administrator Notifications How to Edit Notifications Help Features and Settings Emails Notifications Apply Notifications Site Notifications: Overview How to Access Site Notifications Applicant Notifications Reviewer Notifications Recommender Notifications Administrator Notifications How to Edit Notifications Site Notifications are commonly used emails that are sent out of the site that SurveyMonkey Apply has already set up for you. This article will explain the various notifications available, how to enable/disable certain notifications, and how to edit the default email text to meet your own needs. Site Notifications: Overview Within this section of the site, you can manage emails that are commonly used to invite users to your site and communicate user progress. You will not be able to add or remove any of these Notifications, however, optional Notifications can be enabled/disabled as needed, and if additional emails are needed to be sent out automatically Automated Emails can also be configured. Within each section are both System Notification and Optional Notifications. Our System Notifications are necessary for the functionality of your site, and therefore cannot be disabled. However, the default text can be edited to suit your needs and can also include piping variables to further customize a notification to the user receiving the email. NOTE: We do not recommend completely removing existing Piping Variables within the default email text as they are useful in carrying out actions in the email. For example, the {{ site_title.link }} variable will send a customized link to the user to be able to login to the site. It will also prompt users who don't have a password to be able to create one. Therefore, without this variable in the email, the user may not be able to login to the site. How to Access Site Notifications Select the Settings menu Click Emails Enter the Notifications tab Applicant Notifications The following Notifications will be sent to Applicants based on specific actions that may occur in the site. Listed below are the available notifications under this tab and the applicable action. System Notifications Notification Description of Notification Invitation Email This email will send out when the Applicant is Sent an Invite . Email Confirmation This email will send out when the Applicant initially registers to the site.

Collaborator Invitation Accepted This email will send to the collaborators when they have confirmed the invitation and successfully have access to the site. Recommendation Request Accepted This will send to the applicant when the recommender has accepted the recommendation request. An email is sent to the applicant who made the request to notify them. Recommendation Request Declined This will send to the applicant when the recommender has declined the recommendation request. An email is sent to the applicant who made the request to notify them.

System Notifications Notification Description of Notification Invitation Email This email will send out when the Administrator is Sent an Invite by another administrator.

This will only be sent out if specified by the Admin or Reviewer adding the note. Optional Notifications Notification Description of Notification Welcome Message This email will send out when the Administrator initially confirms their email address within the site completing their registration. How to Edit Notifications By default, the notifications will be populated with template text that is recommended to use for your process in the site. However, you also have the option of editing this text in order to customize the verbiage to suit your needs. In order to edit a notification: Go to Notifications Click on the Role tab based on which notification you wish to edit Click on the Edit icon to the right of the notification description Make your desired changes to the subject and email body Press Save . NOTE: The template notifications are also pre-populated with Piping Variables such as the {{ site.title_link }} which will send custom information to the user that sends in.

TIP! If you do make an alteration to either the text or the piping variables, you can always click Reset to Default to restore the email to the original template text.

How to Apply a Status to an Application,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/monitor/apply-app-status/,"How to Apply a Status to an Application | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article How to Apply a Status through the Stage Settings How to Manually Apply a Status How to Automatically Apply a Status How it Appears in the Site Help Monitor How to Apply a Status to an Application Apply How to Apply a Status to an Application How to Apply a Status through the Stage Settings How to Manually Apply a Status How to Automatically Apply a Status How it Appears in the Site Application Statuses allow you to add a custom status to your applications based on the round the application is in. This article will walk through how to apply a status to an application that is visible to the applicant. How to Apply a Status through the Stage Settings Once you have created a status within your stage you can choose to automatically apply one status to all applications that enter that stage. This will not only apply the status to the application but it will also enable the status to be visible to the applicant on their application. To apply a status automatically to applications that enter the stage: Go to the Stage Configurations of the stage the status should be applied in. Go to the Settings Tab. Under the Application Status section, select the status that has been created. This will not apply retroactively to applications that are already in the stage, only incoming applications. If necessary, you will need to apply the status manually to applications currently in the stage. How to Manually Apply a Status There are 3 ways to apply a status manually: By moving the Application to a new stage Within the Admin Application Preview Within Manage Applications By moving the Application to a new stage Go to the Manage Applications page within a program. Select the checkbox to the left of the application's title. Select Move Stage . Select the stage to move the application to from the drop-down menu. Click the Status you wish to Set. Select Move . TIP! Use these steps to apply a status to multiple applications at once. If you do not wish to move the applications to a different stage you can simply select the stage they are currently in. This will also fire any automations that have been setup to fire based on the application moving to this stage. Within the Admin Application Preview Go to the Manage Applications page within a program. Select the application ID to enter the Admin Application Preview. Click Status . Select the status you wish to apply. Within Manage Applications Go to the Manage Applications page within a program Select the application(s) you wish to add or change the status for. Click Workflow . Click Change Status . Select the status you wish to give the application based on the stage they are in. Click Change Status . How to Automatically Apply a Status In some cases, you may have multiple statuses within a single stage that you wish to apply. If this is the case you can use Automations to apply different statuses to different applications within a single stage. For example, in some cases, after an applicant has moved through the review stage, they may need to be sent back to the application stage to make updates or corrections to their application. This action is based on a reviewer response in the reviewer form to move the application back to the application stage. The reason we use an automation is that we do not want to apply a status to all applications in the stage, only ones that have been in the Reviewer stage and been moved back. WHEN TO APPLY Source Event Target Review Reviewer has completed a Review Reviewer Stage CONDITIONS Reviewer Form: Would you like to request more information from the Applicant? is exactly Yes DO Action Source Action Application Assign a Status to the Application Status: Additional Information Required TIP! Add an action to send an automated email to the applicant to inform them of what information may be required based on a comment field in the reviewer form. To automatically Remove a Status , select the Status in the automation Action to be ""None."" How it Appears in the Site Once you have applied a status to an application it will be visible to your applicants on their application tile. Therefore, when the applicant logs into their account they will be able to quickly identify where their application is in the process. Using the above example we can also notify the applicants that additional information is required in their application and they will need to enter their application to complete it.

Have your IT team add the TXT record to your domain’s DNS settings. Let our support team know that you’ve updated your domain settings. We’ll verify your domain and let you know when it’s ready to use. Once your custom domain is ready, you can select it as the sender email address when creating your survey email. Some domains are authenticated with a DMARC record to prevent third-party services (such as GetFeedback) from sending as that domain on your behalf. If you domain has this type of record attached to it, you won't be able to use your domain name. DMARC policies are set up by your own IT team and we can't override them.

This article will cover the basics of default pages as well as how to add and manage additional pages to be used as resources for users with select roles. What are Pages? How to Access Pages Pages are managed by site administrators and are completely customizable. Images, files and other content can be added to these pages to tailor the content to your users while following the same theme and layout as rest of your SM Apply site. To access your existing pages or to create a new page you will first need to go to the Pages section of your site. To access Pages: Select the Settings menu Select Pages Page Portals Pages are added to provide informational resources for users within the site. They can be made available to all visitors or targeted to specific roles. For example, pages can be accessible by applicants to provide instructions or templates needed to complete their applications. Alternatively, pages can be accessible only to reviewers in order to provide score sheets or benchmarks to assist with completing reviews. There are three areas where pages can be added: the Public Portal , the Applicant Portal , and the Reviewer Portal . These areas are described in more detail later in this article. Page Feature Terminology Common features and settings appear when creating or editing a new page. To prep you for creating your own pages, refer to the descriptions below. Feature Description Title The title page that appears to the visitor. Menu Label This label is presented in the Pages menu and will redirect a user to this page when selected. Page Slug This value completes the URL of the page to direct users successfully. The layout of this URL will be https://yoursite.smapply.io/res/p/slughere Content The text input here can contain pictures, links, lists, etc. to design the page for your users. Page content can be edited at any time. Visibility Enable one of two settings to adjust the visibility of the page to users within your site. Hidden: Hidden pages do not appear in the Pages menu and can't be accessed even when a direct link is provided. Visible: Visible pages are displayed in the taskbar at the top of the user's screen. Visible pages made available to certain roles will only appear for users with that role. For example, applicants cannot see reviewer pages and reviewers cannot see applicant pages. Hide from menu (Unlisted) Unlisted pages are accessible only with a direct link to the page. This can be in the form of a hyperlink displayed in through hyperlink text or a link sent through email. Page will be hidden from the user's Pages menu. The Public Portal The Public Portal is the first tab within the Pages section. Within this tab, administrators can customize various pages available to anyone visiting the site (including non-members). There are three configurable areas within the Public Portal tab: Site Pages & Menu Public pages are added from this location. To add a Public Page : Go to Pages Select Add Page Add a Page title Add a Menu label (this is the title that will appear in the Pages drop-down menu on the home screen) Customize your page slug. It is only required to add the ending of the URL which will appear after https://yoursite.smapply.io/res/p/ Build your page in the content text box Select Preview to review your page Select Save Site Homepage The selected page will act as the site homepage where users will sign in or choose to register for an account. How to Edit Your Homepage To edit your site homepage: Locate your selected homepage within the Site pages & menu section of the Public Portal Select the More Options icon Select Edit Edit the content and preview to review your changes Select Save ""Redirect Homepage to a Specific Program"" Setting Enabling Redirect homepage to a specific program allows you to display a program's landing page as your homepage. The contents of this page can be edited from the Program Settings (link) by editing the Full Description of the program you are redirecting to. When a program's homepage is used, the login fields will be presented on the page to allow visitors to sign in. TIP! This setting is useful to advertise a specific program accepting applications and can be ideal when a site hosts only a select number of programs that do not run simultaneously. Program Listing Selecting a page in this section will determine where your program list will appear for visitors to your site. This list will consist of all available programs within your site at that point in time. If you don't want your programs publicly listed, check the ""No listing page"" option. The Applicant Portal Default Applicant Pages There are two default application pages as well as any additional applicant pages you wish to add as resources for your applicants. Default pages are required and cannot be deleted. The two default applicant pages are: My Applications The ""My Applications"" page displays a summary of the user's applications including their progress, status and date the application was last edited. Programs A list of programs applicants can apply to if they meet eligibility requirements. See How to Edit Pages for step by step instructions to edit default pages. Additional Applicant Pages Additional application pages will be displayed as additional resources to applicants only. Pages marked as visible will be accessible from the taskbar at the top of the page when the user signs in or by accessing the page URL directly. Some examples of pages that may be added here are instruction pages to complete an application, information on the award process, and templates for completing a specific task. To add additional applicant pages: Select Add Page Create a Page title Add a Menu label. T his will be the title of the resource within the Pages dropdown menu in the user's taskbar.

See How to Edit Pages for step by step instructions to edit default pages. Additional Reviewer Pages Additional reviewer pages will be available within the Pages drop-down for the user once they are signed in or by selecting a link to a page you have added. Some examples of pages that would be presented to reviewers could be scoring rubrics, instructions to complete a review or a database of fellow reviewers. To add additional reviewer pages: While in Pages, select the Reviewer Portal tab Select Add Page Create a Page title Add a Menu label. This will be the title of the resource within the Pages dropdown menu in the user's taskbar. Customize the unique page slug.

Breaking Changes in Live Surveys,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/builder/breaking-changes-in-live-surveys/,"Breaking Changes in Live Surveys | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article What is a breaking change? What happens when you make a breaking change? What changes will break web forms? How do I fix a broken form? What are non-breaking changes? Help Survey Builder Managing Surveys Breaking Changes in Live Surveys GetFeedback Breaking Changes in Live Surveys What is a breaking change? What happens when you make a breaking change? What changes will break web forms? How do I fix a broken form? What are non-breaking changes? What is a breaking change? A breaking change is a structural change made to your questions in your web button , campaign , or widget after it was saved the first time. What happens when you make a breaking change? The form will stop syncing to Insights entirely from the moment the breaking change is made. If you can’t see any data in Insights after adding the form to your workspace, the form has been broken. When you add a choice element (such as a radio button) to the form with only 1 answer option, the form cannot be added to your workspace as it won't show up in the list of forms. What changes will break web forms? The following changes can stop your survey from syncing to Insights. Removing an element with a specific identifier, saving your form, and then adding a new element of a different type with the same identifier. Example : You have a radio button element with the identifier “selection.” You remove this element and then add a checkbox element with the exact same identifier. Removing a choice question, such as rating or checkbox, with a specific number of answer options, saving your form, and then replacing it with the same type of element and identifier but using a different number of answer options. Example : You have a checkbox element with the identifier “checkbox” that has 3 answer options. You remove this, add a new checkbox element with the identifier “checkbox,” but this one has 5 answer options. Directly modifying the identifier of the element (only possible with In-Page widgets ). Adding a choice element (radio button, checkbox) with only 1 answer option. How do I fix a broken form? Broken forms can’t be fixed and won’t sync to Insights again. To sync the form to Insights, duplicate your broken form, running the duplicate version, and adding that form to your workspace. What are non-breaking changes? There are several changes you can make to a form without breaking it, including: Adding a new element (if it doesn’t have the same identifier as a previously removed element) Removing an element Changing any text within the survey, including headings, paragraph text, questions, answer options, low/high text of NPS, Mood rating labels, and more Changing the survey theme Changing the security settings, such as enabling IP address or location collection (in the Advanced settings) Changing the order of the elements by dragging them around Making elements required Changing the targeting criteria of the survey Changing the scheduling options of the survey Changing the visibility rules or jump rules Changing the name of the form, campaign, or widget Related Articles Sharing and Transferring Surveys Error: “No such column” in Salesforce Getting Started with GetFeedback for Salesforce Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice Copyright © 1999-2025 SurveyMonkey BBB credentials logo TrustedSite logo"

How to Build a Budget Form,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/budget-form/,"How to Build a Budget Form | Apply Help Log in Apply In this article Building the Questions Calculating the Sub Totals Calculating the Grand Total/Difference Asking users to update their budget later on Help Build Forms How to Build a Budget Form Apply How to Build a Budget Form Building the Questions Calculating the Sub Totals Calculating the Grand Total/Difference Asking users to update their budget later on If you require your applicants to complete a budget within your site this can be achieved internally within your form. Alternatively, if you wish for a budget to be uploaded to the application, you can consider uploading a template to the Files section and have them upload it to an Attach File task . NOTE: The calculations provided in this article are examples that can be referenced for formatting purposes. Your calculations will vary based on your own configurations. For more information on setting up calculations, you can refer to Advanced Expression Piping: Overview Building the Questions The most common question types for creating budgets are either Single Column or Multi-Column Questions , using the Text Response variable to allow users to enter their totals. When building out a budget there are often two different sections for the user to complete: Revenue/Income and Expenses. In some cases, you may only request the expenses of the applicants. For this example, we will walk through requesting information about someone's Income and Living Expenses. Start by adding Single Column and/or Multi-Column questions to the form. Set up the rows and columns to allow for applicants to enter their amounts and any other information you need to collect Set a Floating Point Validation on the fields/columns. This will ensure that the values are entered in the correct format to be accepted in the calculation. Set an Identifier on the question. This is an important step to be able to calculate the totals. Repeat the above steps for each section that you need to collect. For our example, this may include Income, Rent/Utilities, Loans, Auto, etc. NOTE: For Step 3, commas and spaces will not be accepted in a calculation and will cause an error if the user enters them in their response. Here are two possible examples of a question setup, however, you can customize your question as you need to. These examples will be referenced throughout the article: Setup A: Multi-Column Setup B: Single Column Calculating the Sub Totals Add in either a Text Response, Hidden Field , and/or Section Heading directly below the question. After each Single-/Multi-Column question that we add, we want to see what the sub-total is for each question. For more information on which question type you should choose, you can refer to Knowing which Question Type to Use Next, we will create our calculation using the identifier we have set on the section. Review Setup A: Multi-Column and Setup B: Single Column below for steps to create your calculation. Setup A: Multi Column Though there are multiple columns in the question, for this example, we only want to calculate the second column into our subtotal. In the Initial Value or Description of the question, start your expression by adding 2 curly brackets {{ Add a space after the second bracket Enter SUM() Within the closed brackets add the identifier, which will be case sensitive. For this example, we set the identifier to be ""income"" Add the column indexing. The Amount column is the second column in the question so it will be [:1] For more information, see Index an Entire Column After your expression, add a space Close your rule with 2 closed curly brackets }} Enable Restore Initial Value to ensure your formula always recalculates if a user changes their responses. When we're done, our questions will look like: Setup B: Single Column Within the Initial Value or Description of the question, start your expression by adding 2 curly brackets {{ Add a space after the second bracket Enter SUM() Within the closed brackets add the identifier, which will be case sensitive. For our example, we set the identifier to be ""rent"" After your expression, add a space Close your rule with 2 closed curly brackets }} Enable Restore Initial Value to ensure your formula always recalculates if a user changes their responses. Since we only have the one column we don't need to reference the column as we do for Multi-Column. Therefore, our final setup will appear as: Calculating the Grand Total/Difference First, we can find the total amount of the expenses incurred (Rent + Loans + Auto). Now that we have added all of our questions and calculated all of our Sub Totals, we want to calculate everything together to determine what the grand total or difference is. This calculation will appear as such, depending on the question type: Setup A: Multi Columns Setup B: Single Columns {{ SUM(rent[:1],loans[:1],auto[:1]) }} {{ SUM(rent,loans,auto) }} If you are then looking to find the difference between your Income and Expenses, the calculation may be: {{ (SUM(income[:1])) - (SUM(rent,loans,auto)) }} NOTE: When performing the above calculations, be aware of our In-Form Piping restrictions which prevent you from performing calculations on a piped value on the same page. For more information, you can refer to our help section on Same Page vs. Next Page Piping Asking users to update their budget later on As time passes, budgets can change. If you need to ask your applicants to update their budget after initially submitting their application, this can best be done using Reusable Applicant Tasks . If you set up your Budget as a Reusable Applicant task you can have a different instance of the same form in a later stage or even in a different program. You can also have the responses auto-populated in the second version of the form to allow the applicant to see their original responses and update them as necessary.

Salesforce Conditional Mapping,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/salesforce/salesforce-conditional-mapping/,"Salesforce Conditional Mapping | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback Help Salesforce Salesforce Conditional Mapping GetFeedback Salesforce Conditional Mapping Essentials feature : Available on Essentials, Pro, and Ultimate plans. With Conditional Mapping, you can choose to map only certain responses to Salesforce to ensure you’re reaching the right people at the right time. For example, you may only want to create a new contact when someone gives you a response of “Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied” on a Customer Satisfaction score question. Or, you may want one survey response to create a case and another response to go to your Sales team and create a lead. Before You Start Connect your Salesforce environment to GetFeedback. Then, create your survey and connect it to Salesforce . Setting up Conditional Mapping To set up conditional mapping: From the survey builder, select Mappings > Salesforce Custom Mappings . Select a Salesforce object to map to. Select an action to perform on the object. For Select a mapping condition , choose Only when . Select + Add filters , then add the condition for your mappings. You can base your filters on the following attributes: The answer to a question (only for Rating Grid, Multiple Choice Grid, and Rank questions) A merge field The response language Repeat to add more filters as needed. If you add multiple filters, your feedback must match all filters to be mapped to Salesforce. Select Continue to keep setting up your custom mapping . Example : We want to create a new case each time a respondent gives a response that ""the wait time was too long."" Set the condition to The answer to , then choose the question to use. Then, choose Is equal to and enter “The wait time was too long.” Using Field-Level Conditional Mapping Like conditional mappings, field-level conditional mappings use 'AND' rules to define what does and does not get mapped to Salesforce. For example, you might want responses mapped to Salesforce for a particular question only when they match or contain one of your merge fields. While conditional mappings set conditions on the entire mapping, field-level conditional mappings create conditions on individual fields that you’re mapping to Salesforce. You can use a variety of conditional and non-conditional rules when building your mappings. To use field-level mapping: Create your mapping . Once you save your mapping, you can create more conditions on the answers , merge fields , response attributes , question text , and fixed values that you want to map to Salesforce. Supported Data Types Every field within Salesforce has a defined data type and can only accept data from specific GetFeedback question types. For example, when you use the Salesforce app, you can't put a long string of text in a field that expects a number.

See Navigation Buttons for more info on how to customize these extra buttons. Partial Responses Multi-page forms also introduce the possibility of receiving partial entries—people might fill out and submit page 1, but abandon the form on page 2 without submitting their complete response. We track what percentage of the form someone went through before abandoning the form, and we make this info visible in entries and reports. In the Entry Manager we show the percentage of the form that the person completed before abandoning. In the Report Builder you'll see two new columns: Last Page Accessed - Shows the last page the user tried to fill out before they left Complete Submission - A yes or no indicating whether the person made it through the entire form.

CES (Customer Effort Score) Metric measuring customer satisfaction; based on creating loyal customers by reducing customer effort. Example: ""How much do you agree with the following statement on a scale of 1-5?: The company made it easy for me to handle my issue.” Conditional Forms Forms containing questions that change based on the feedback topic.

Use a custom third option if you notice the feedback button used to leave feedback about things other than the website, such as customer service. With the third option, you can add a link to the customer service contact page to reduce unwanted feedback. Emotional/Mood Rating The key metric offered by GetFeedback Digital. It is the first default element in your feedback forms that collects the general mood of the respondent.

Taking Surveys in Messenger SurveyMonkey Bot Data & Privacy The Facebook Messenger collector is no longer available to send new surveys. The information below is relevant to past surveys you may have sent. Did you send us a message? If you messaged us from our Facebook page, we'll do our best to get back to you as soon as possible. However, using our help center ensures you'll get the most immediate answers to your questions. Just enter a search term or browse by topic at the top of this page—chances are, we have an article that addresses your issue and you'll be on your way to sending a great survey! And if you need a little extra help, each article page contains a link to contact support. Taking Surveys in Messenger SurveyMonkey is an easy-to-use online tool where anyone can create and send surveys. Survey creators can post a public link you might see in your news feed. Clicking the survey link from one of these messages or posts opens a chat with SurveyMonkey in Messenger where you take the survey. Taking surveys in Messenger is easy, and the SurveyMonkey bot will walk you through it. But just in case, here are a few tips to help you along the way: For multiple-choice questions, just choose an answer. If you're taking the survey on the Messenger desktop app, you'll see the Get Started button and answer options for each question at the very bottom of the screen, right above where you type a message. For textbox questions, type in your answer and hit enter. You'll know it's a textbox question if you don't see any answer options to select. If you didn't finish taking a survey within a couple hours, you'll see the option to continue the survey if you re-open your chat. You can take the survey multiple times—all you need to do is click or tap the survey link again. If you haven't finished taking the survey, you'll need to complete it before you can take it again. Your past responses are stored in your chat history with the SurveyMonkey bot, but you're not able to edit them. You can delete responses from your chat history, but that doesn't delete responses from SurveyMonkey. If you see an error message when you open the survey or when you reach a particular question, you'll want to reach out to the survey owner. The survey might be expired or closed, or there may be an issue with the survey design. SurveyMonkey Bot The SurveyMonkey bot makes it possible for people to share and take surveys in Messenger . Bots for Messenger are a bit like smartphone apps—companies can build bots for Messenger that do all sorts of things, like place take-out orders, confirm reservations at a hotel, or send receipts from a recent purchase. If you're chatting with SurveyMonkey in Messenger and answering questions, it's likely someone in your Facebook network shared a survey in Messenger . Depending on your Facebook privacy settings, survey creators can send a survey directly to you in Messenger, or they can post a public link you might see in your news feed. Data and Privacy If you're taking a survey in Messenger, your response is recorded in the survey creator's SurveyMonkey account, and it's associated with your first and last name from Facebook. At this time, the survey creator can't make the survey anonymous . To understand how SurveyMonkey handles respondents’ personal information, please review our Privacy Notice . If you took the survey in Messenger, Facebook may have access to your responses—please see Facebook's Data Policy for additional information.

Tagging Responses,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/tagging-responses/,"Tagging Responses | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Rule-based Tagging Using Rules Manual Tagging Managing Tags Filtering by Tags Exporting Tags Help Analyzing Results Text Responses Tagging Responses SurveyMonkey Tagging Responses Rule-based Tagging Using Rules Manual Tagging Managing Tags Filtering by Tags Exporting Tags Tagging Responses Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan. Log in Sign up free Create tags to categorize responses to questions with open-ended text responses. You can create rule-based tags , or tag responses manually . Once you add tags to your responses, they'll be visible in the survey's Question Summaries tab or when viewing individual responses . Rule-based Tagging ENTERPRISE FEATURE : This feature is only available for Enterprise customers. Please contact our sales team to learn more. Rule-based tagging lets you automatically tag responses based on keywords or phrases. For example, if there is a certain word in your responses you want tagged, the created rule will tag existing responses and any new responses that come in. Rule-based tagging uses word stemming to find the root of your keyword. This allows us to tag other versions of it. For example, if you create a rule for the keyword Caused, we'll also look for Cause and Causing. ENGLISH ONLY : Rule-based tagging is only available in English at this time. To create a rule-based tag from the Responses tab: In the Analyze Results section, scroll to a question with open-ended text responses. Go to the Responses tab. In the Search Responses bar, enter keyword(s) or phrase(s). Your responses automatically filter. Select + Create Tag . (Optional) Edit tag label and color. Click Save . To create a rule-based tag from the Tags tab: In the Analyze Results section, scroll to a question with open-ended text responses. Go to the Tags tab. Select +New Tag. In the Tag name bar, specify the name and color of the tag. In the Keywords bar, enter the keyword(s) or phrase(s) to be automatically tagged. Click Save . TIP! Use the table of rules below to help you search for even more specific words or phrases. Using Rules Rules Description Examples Response matches exact phrase Use quotation marks to search for exact phrases. Search results much match exact what you type between the quotes. ""yellow flowers"" Response matches multiple keywords or phrases Type AND between words or exact phrases to find responses that match both words and/or phrases rose AND carnation AND ""yellow flower"" Response matches either keyword or phrase Type OR between words or exact phrases to find responses that match either words or phrases. rose OR carnation OR “red flower” Response does not include Type NOT directly in front of any word or phrase that you want to exclude from your search. red flower NOT rose Response starts with Type * after a word to search responses starting with those letters. flow* (results will show flows, flowers, flowing) Response includes a typo To locate responses that may include a typo, type part of the word, then ~, followed by the number of characters in the word. flo~3 (to find responses with flower, but the word has typos like, flwoer, fleowr, folwer) carn~5 (to find responses with carnation, but the word has typos like, carntaion, carnaiton, carntiaon) Response combines the above rules Use a combination of AND , OR, or NOT rules to search responses. (red AND rose) OR (yellow AND rose) AND NOT carnation Manual Tagging If you don’t want responses tagged automatically, you also have the option to tag responses one by one. To create tags for different forms of the same word, consider using Rule-based tagging instead (English only). To create a manual tag: Go to the Responses tab. Use the checkboxes to select one or more responses. Select the Tag button and choose an existing tag or create a new one. Click Apply . Managing Tags To remove an applied tag from the Responses tab, select Clear next to the name of the tag. The Tags tab shows all the tags you created. You can edit, delete, or add new tags from this tab. If a response is edited, any tags applied to that response will be removed. Filtering by Tags You can filter text responses by tag—either within a question or across your entire survey. Expand | Collapse Filtering within a question When you filter by tag within a question, you're displaying all of that question's responses with a specific tag. For example, if you want to only see the responses you tagged ""yellow flowers"". You can also choose to display any untagged responses. To filter by tags within a question: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Scroll to a question with text responses. Go to the Responses tab. Click Filter by Tags . Select which tags you want to display. Click Apply . Filtering across a survey When you filter by tag across a survey, you're displaying responses to every question in your survey from people who responded to a question with a specific tag. For example, if you tagged responses with ""Complaint"" and wanted to see how those people responded to the rest of your survey. To filter by tag across an entire survey, create a Filter rule to filter by tag. Exporting Tags Exports Paid feature Log in to see if this feature is included in your plan.

Log in Sign up free ENGLISH ONLY: Advanced Piping is only available when the survey language is set to English. Advanced Piping lets you insert text like custom variables , custom data from Contacts , or a respondent's answer to a previous question into your survey—allowing you to personalize your survey questions for each unique respondent based on who they are and how they answer certain questions in your survey. Advanced Piping is related to Question & Answer Piping , which is a simpler version of this feature that only lets you insert text from one data source: previous questions in the survey. Adding Advanced Piping To use Advanced Piping: Click the textbox you want to insert text into. See a list of the supported fields below. Click Insert text from... . Select a data source from the menu. You can choose from previous questions, contacts, or custom variables. When you insert text from one of the available data sources into your survey, the following syntax is inserted into the textbox: {{ expression }} When a respondent takes your survey, the output of the expression will replace the brackets based on their unique answers, or the custom data or custom variables associated with them. Supported Fields Supported Fields Limitations Question Text Not applicable (N/A) Answer Choices You can't pipe into the answer choices of a Matrix of Dropdown question . Row Labels N/A Column Labels N/A ""Other"" Textbox Labels Piping may not work when applied to an 'Other' answer choice that has been carried forward . Available Data Sources You can reference the following data sources in the Advanced Piping expressions you create. Some data sources are only supported when you send your survey to respondents through specific collector types, as noted below. You can't pipe questions into page 1 of a survey, but you can pipe custom data from contacts and custom variables into page 1. If you have anonymous responses turned on for your Email Invitation collector, it's not possible to use custom data from contacts for Advanced Piping. Sources Source Description Compatible Collector Types Question Text from the following question types : Multiple Choice, Star Rating, Dropdown, Matrix/Rating Scale, Net Promoter® Score, Image Choice (only captions), Comment Box, Single Textbox, Slider, Matrix of Dropdown Menus, Multiple Textboxes, and Contact Information All collector types Custom Data from Contacts The custom data about your respondents that's stored in Contacts. For example: Email, First Name, Last Name, Custom 1, etc. Email Invitation Custom Variables The values of the custom variables in the survey URL. Web Link Previewing & Testing Advanced Piping The best ways to test Advanced Piping before sending your survey to respondents differs depending on the data sources you reference in your Advanced Piping expressions. Expand | Collapse Testing Piping Based on Questions If all of the Advanced Piping in your survey is based on a respondent's answer text, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select. Testing Piping Based on Custom Data from Contacts If any of your conditions are based on custom data from Contacts , the best way to test your survey is to create a group in your Contacts and then send an Email Invitation to that group. When you create a test group, include email addresses that you have access to for testing. When you add custom data to those contacts, make sure that you fill in all the Custom Data fields that you based Advanced Piping on. For example, if you use the Custom 1 field to record each contact's department, and you're piping that information into your survey, make sure to add information into the Custom Data 1 field for your test contact. When you're done testing, delete your test responses . Testing Piping Based on Custom Variables If any of your Advanced Piping conditions are based on custom variables , the best way to test your survey is to create a Web Link and edit the variables in the URL to make sure the proper variables are being passed through to your survey. When you're done testing, delete your test responses . Survey Behavior Any expression between double curly brackets is evaluated by Advanced Piping when a respondent takes your survey. If there is no answer, custom data, or custom variable to replace the template with, the bracketed template is simply replaced by a blank space, so your respondents will never see bracketed templates in your survey. Analyzing Your Results In the Analyze Results section, the bracketed Advanced Piping templates appear in the question and answer text just as they do as you're designing your survey. The outputs of Advanced Piping aren't recorded in the Analyze Results section. They're only evaluated on the survey page as a respondent takes the survey—to provide a more custom experience. You can filter your results by question & answer or respondent metadata, to see how respondent information relates to their responses to the rest of the questions in the survey.

Let your respondents make payments via PayPal right within your form or survey. You can either assign prices to a single question to charge different amounts per answer option, or charge a fixed price for your entire form. Connecting to PayPal and adding a payment page PayPal is a third-party payment processor that lets you securely accept and manage payments online. You'll need to connect a PayPal Business or Personal account before you can add the payment option to your form to accept payments. Only the form owner can connect their PayPal account. You can't connect a PayPal account to surveys that are shared with you. Form creators can learn more about PayPal’s merchant fees associated with accepting payments. Creating Your Form to Accept Payments Payment pages display at the end of your form. This means people need to complete your form in order to see the payment page. For a quick payment experience, try to make a short and simple form. Prices must be a whole number between $1-$10,000 in most accepted currencies . To create a form that accepts payments with PayPal: Create a survey. From the Design Survey tab, select Options , and then select Payment . Choose PayPal as the payment processor to collect payments. If it’s your first time adding the PayPal Payment option, click Connect to PayPal and follow the instructions to log in or sign up. Once connected into PayPal, select the Currency you wish to collect payments in. Under Payment amount , choose to assign the: Same amount for everyone —all users are charged the same amount regardless of their responses. Enter a Description for the payment and a Price . Payment linked to a question —people are charged based on the answer they select or enter in the payment question. Select the Payment question you want to assign payment prices to. You can assign prices to Multiple Choice , Dropdown , or Image Choice questions, or You can assign a minimum or maximum amount to a Single Textbox question so the respondent can pay an amount they choose. Enter the Price per answer option . Add prices to each answer option. Click Save . A Payment page gets added to the end of your form. If you wish to update the language on the Payment page, you can click directly on Submit your payment to update the text displayed to respondents. PayPal is free and easy to set up, but if you have any issues connecting your accounts you can reach out to the PayPal support team. You can click Manage account from the side panel to open My Account to manage PayPal from Linked Accounts. You can preview the form to see prices appear on the question and the PayPal checkout display, however it isn’t possible to test making a payment and no transactions can be processed while previewing. Editing a form that accepts payment Changes to prices or currency will go into effect immediately for new responses. Editing a question with payment associated may be limited if this form already has responses. TIP! If you have a limited amount of tickets or items that you want to accept payment for, you can add a quota to your form. Once the quota has been met, the form closes and respondents won't see the payment page. Turning Off Payments You can stop accepting payments from your form at any time by closing your form. If you delete the form question associated with payments after you’ve collected responses, you will also delete any transaction records from previous payments in the Analyze Results section. You'll always be able to see your complete transaction record in your PayPal account. If you disconnect your PayPal account in My Account , you won't be able to collect any additional payments from your forms or surveys. Currency Options Forms creators can only charge in the following currencies: AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NOK, NZD, SEK, SGD, and USD. People taking your survey have plenty of options to pay . Collecting Responses After you design your form, create a collector to send it out and start accepting payments. You can send a form with a payment page using any collector type , except for Audience, Mobile SDK, and Offline Mode. After a respondent submits a payment, they won't be able to return to the form even when Response Editing is on. Viewing Payment Transactions and Responses When someone submits a payment through your form, PayPal collects all of the details from the payment page, which means SurveyMonkey never saves or stores any credit card numbers. You can go to the Analyze Results section of your form to see the transactions made along with responses in your Question summary or Tabular view. You'll find them at the very bottom of your form results. The Payment Summary shows: PayPal’s Charge ID The amount paid The date and time The item description The respondent's first and last name The transaction status This is only a snapshot of each payment taken at the time the form is completed.

Button,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/getfeedback/channels/web-buttons/,"Button | GetFeedback Help Log in GetFeedback In this article Creating a Feedback Button Types of Feedback Forms The Form Editor The Intro Screen The Exit Screen Previewing Your Form Uploading Custom Buttons Help Survey channels Website Button GetFeedback Button Creating a Feedback Button Types of Feedback Forms The Form Editor The Intro Screen The Exit Screen Previewing Your Form Uploading Custom Buttons The first step in collecting customer feedback with GetFeedback for Web is creating a feedback button. Creating a Feedback Button To create a feedback button: Go to the Setup page in the Buttons & Forms menu. You can find the Buttons and Forms menu in the left navigation bar when you're logged in to GetFeedback at https://app.usabilla.com . On the Setup page, select Create new button in the top-right corner. Then, you’ll add a name, color, and shape for your button. If needed, you can change these settings later. (optional) Customize the Attention Grabber , Security Settings , and Advanced Settings . Select Generate and install to create your button. On the next page, you’ll find the code to install your button as well as a preview of your new button. To use your button, you’ll need to edit your feedback form by selecting Edit Form . Types of Feedback Forms Now that your feedback button is created, you’ll create a feedback form. You have two options to choose from: The default form is the GetFeedback provided feedback form shown once the customer clicks your feedback button. A custom form can be used to override the default form on specific pages. Learn more about custom forms There are 3 steps to create your button: The Form Editor , where you can add questions to your survey. The Intro Screen Editor , where you format the introduction screen when visitors click on the feedback button. The Exit Screen Editor , where you format the exit screen visitors see after they give feedback. The Form Editor The form editor lets you design your feedback form, with options to customize the form language, types of feedback your customers can leave and more. Scroll down to learn more about each option. Language GetFeedback for Web supports 20+ languages . Selecting a language in the drop-down menu will set all the default text of the feedback form to that language. Only default form questions are updated when you change the language. Custom questions aren't translated. Visual Feedback Settings The Visual Feedback setting lets you choose which feedback your customers can leave through your form. There are 4 options: Specific or Generic : Respondents can choose which type of feedback to leave. Always Specific : Respondents always have to specify a part of your website they want to leave feedback about. Always Generic : Respondents can't choose a specific site element to leave feedback about. This option removes the intro screen from your feedback form. No visual feedback : When respondents leave feedback, no screenshots will be taken. Respondents can't choose a part of the page they want to leave feedback about. This option also removes the intro screen from your feedback form. If there's privacy-sensitive information on your web pages, this option ensures you don’t collect any sensitive information. Customizing Form Elements While editing your feedback form, you’ll see a preview in the center of the screen. The form may look slightly different after installation on your page. At the top of the feedback form, you’ll find the mood rating question. This question gives you a direct insight your customers’ sentiment. This question is always the first in your form and can't be removed. To use a star rating or like/dislike as the first question, contact your Customer Success Manager. All other questions can be re-ordered using the drag icon. The drag icon can be identified by the hamburger icon on the side and a changed mouse cursor when you hover over it. You can remove, or edit all elements by hovering over them and clicking the remove/edit buttons. The edit button is indicated with an “edit” label and the delete button is indicated with a trash can icon. All elements have different editing options. You can find a detailed description of all form elements in our other Support Articles. From the ‘Form Controls’ menu on the left, you can add new elements to your form. We recommend you add no more than 3 questions in your feedback form. Having fewer questions will increase the amount of feedback you’ll receive. Getting too much feedback? Add additional questions to filter responses. Conditional Forms Next, we have a special element that you can add to your feedback form. The ‘Conditional Forms drop-down’. This drop-down element allows you to ask your visitor to specify the type of feedback that they’re leaving, and show them alternative follow-up questions based on their answer. Learn more Advanced settings Theme The ‘Theme’ drop-down allows you to select the look of your feedback form. By default, there are two themes (Default and Star Rating). If you have a custom theme it will be shown in this drop-down. Don’t have a customized theme yet? Get in touch with your Customer Success Manager to discuss the options or request one straight away using our request form . Logo (legacy) The ‘Logo’ drop-down allows you to select a logo that will be displayed as a ‘drag handle’ on the top of your feedback form. By default, only the GetFeedback Digital logo is available’. If you have a custom logo, it will be shown in this drop-down. Copy Feedback Form The ‘Copy feedback form’ menu can be used to copy the elements from an existing feedback form to the one you’re editing now. This is especially handy when using multiple feedback buttons. Labels In the ‘Labels’ field, you can set up specific labels that will be automatically attached to all the feedback items that are left through this form. Privacy The ‘Show Privacy Info’ option allows you to add a link to your privacy statement or add some text that will be displayed when the customer moves his mouse pointer over the “privacy info” link. Now that you’re finished with setting up your feedback form, click ‘next’ to edit the Intro screen. The Intro Screen The intro screen is displays when visitors select the Feedback Button. The intro screen is only shown when: Your customers can leave specific or generic feedback Your customers can only leave specific feedback Both of these options have different intro screens. Intro Screen for Specific or Generic Feedback Select Edit in the top right of your form to edit it. You can edit the following options: Mouse start : This is the text your customer sees when they're asked to select a specific part of the website to give feedback (on desktop) Touch start : This is the text your customer sees when they're asked to select a specific part of the website to give feedback (on mobile) Title : adds a title to your intro screen Subtitle : Adds a subtitle to your intro screen Specific title : Changes the title of the ‘specific feedback’ option Specific text : Changes the description of ‘specific feedback’ Generic title : Changes the title of the ‘generic feedback’ option Generic text : Changes the description of ‘generic feedback’ Add custom option : This adds a third button to your intro screen which you can use to redirect visitors to a different part of your website (e.g. your contact page) The editing options allow you to change all the text on this page. When you're ready, select Next to go to the Exit Screen. The Exit Screen Select Edit to change the text on your exit screen. In this menu, you can change options like Title, Text, ""Show more feedback button"", and the Continue Browsing Text. After making your changes, select Save . Previewing Your Form Select Preview to see the button as it will appear on your site. TIP! Select the feedback button to preview it on your website. Then, test it out by submitting it. Uploading Custom Buttons The custom Button Creator tool is only available to power users . Can I upload my own button? Yes! The Button Creator allows you to upload a .png image as a button. This means you can design a button any way you’d like. Where do I upload my button? To upload a custom button: In app.usabilla.com , go to Buttons & Forms , then select Setup . Select Create a New Button . In the banner at the top, select Go to Button Editor . How does it work? Create a .png image for your button and upload it using our Button Creator tool. After uploading, you can specify where the button should be positioned on your web page and adjust the size as needed. We recommend that you upload an image that is twice the size you need. That way you'll be able to downscale it to support high-resolution retina screens. Where can I find my button after saving it? Once you are sure your button looks the way you want it to and hit save, you will land on a page with both standard GetFeedback Digital buttons and your own custom buttons. Your newly created button will be under Custom Buttons. What if I want to edit or delete a button? To edit or delete your custom button, contact your Customer Success Manager. What types of images can I upload? Use a .png image under 2MB. What is Retina support? The option downscale image by 50% (retina support) to ensure quality images on high-resolution screens. Without downscaling, the button may look pixelated on high-resolution retina screens.

Editing a Live Survey | SurveyMonkey Help,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/manage/editing-live-surveys/,"Editing a Live Survey | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey Help Managing & Sharing Surveys Survey Options Editing a Live Survey SurveyMonkey Editing a Live Survey You can edit certain parts of a survey after you send it out. If the survey doesn't have any responses, you can fully edit the survey. If the survey is live, meaning it already has responses, editing options are limited. You're able to: Add new questions Edit existing text Add, edit, or hide answer choices Sort answer choices alphabetically or randomly Delete a question—this deletes responses for the question in your results Move questions or pages—be mindful of any Skip Logic applied Change the point value of a quiz question Edit row and column labels of a Matrix/Rating Scale question Add new rows to a Matrix/Rating Scale question Add or remove question options like requiring an answer or text validation Changes you make to the survey design go live as soon as you save them. The survey link doesn't change, so you don't need to send out a new link or inform anyone the survey has been edited. If you embedded your survey on a website, the embed code won't change either. If you make edits while people are taking your survey the survey page will automatically refresh and their responses won't be saved. If this happens, they’ll see a message letting them know to retake the survey. Editing Limitations Editing is limited after you collect responses since significant changes to the survey design affect your ability to properly analyze results. You can't delete an answer choice if the question has any responses. You can instead hide the answer choice OR delete the question entirely (including any of its responses) and re-add the question. If you need to make edits to the survey that aren't possible because of this limitation, you have a couple options: Expand | Collapse Clear responses and edit the existing survey Export the survey data so you have a copy of the current responses. Clear all survey responses to fully edit the survey (or delete only a specific question from the design). Edit the survey as needed. Using the export for reference, manually upload the responses you deleted (or if you only deleted a specific question, edit individual responses to re-add the responses you deleted). Make a copy of the survey and re-send it Make a copy of the survey. Edit the survey as needed. Re-send the survey to respondents. The survey will have a new link since you need to create a new Collector. Editing Live Surveys in the Mobile App The SurveyMonkey mobile app is great for making small edits to your survey on the go, like fixing typos or adding new questions. However, once you've collected responses to your survey, we suggest making edits on our website instead. For example, deleting an answer choice in the app will permanently remove its responses from the survey, so use caution. If you need to hide an answer choice from future respondents, use our website.

Viewing Benchmarks in Survey Results | SurveyMonkey Help,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/viewing-benchmarks/,"Viewing Benchmarks in Survey Results | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article How to Use Benchmarks Showing and Hiding Benchmarks Analyzing Benchmarks Why can't I see benchmarks? Help Analyzing Results Benchmarks Viewing Benchmarks in Survey Results SurveyMonkey Viewing Benchmarks in Survey Results How to Use Benchmarks Showing and Hiding Benchmarks Analyzing Benchmarks Why can't I see benchmarks? Benchmarks give context to your survey results by allowing you to compare your results to others who used the same Question Bank questions as you. Free Global Benchmarks appear in your survey results if at least one Question Bank question you used has a benchmark. You can also buy more specific Industry Benchmarks to focus on a particular industry. The benchmark icon indicates whether a question is benchmarkable. Look for the benchmark icon in the upper-left corner of a question when analyzing your results. How to Use Benchmarks Creating a Survey To see free Global Benchmarks in your results: Create a benchmarkable survey . Send your survey . Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. You'll see a Benchmarks option in the toolbar. If you haven't completed your profile yet, click Complete Profile at the top of the page. You need to complete your profile before you can view benchmarks. Browse the questions in your survey for the benchmark icon and show benchmarks! TIP! You can see benchmarks even if you haven't collected any survey responses! Just create a survey using benchmarkable questions , then head straight to the Analyze Results section of the survey. Paid Benchmarks You can buy Industry Benchmarks for specific comparison groups to help you narrow down the types of organizations included in a benchmark, like country or industry. On some plans, you get a paid Industry Benchmark for free ! Showing and Hiding Benchmarks You can see benchmarks in the Analyze Results section of any of your surveys in which you used benchmarkable questions . Action Steps Show Benchmark Click Show Benchmark above the question chart to compare your results against the benchmark available for that individual question. Hide Benchmark Click Hide Benchmark to show your results for the question without the benchmark included. Show or Hide All Click the arrow to the right of the benchmark button to reveal the option to show or hide benchmarks for all questions at once. Show Top 25% Available when you buy benchmarks . Select Benchmarks from the toolbar, then click the three dots to the right of a benchmark to add a view that includes only the organizations whose results are in the top 25% of the benchmark. TIP! You can also buy Industry Benchmarks for specific comparison groups to help you narrow down the types of organizations included in a benchmark, like country or industry. Shared Surveys People can see benchmarks on surveys shared by you . Basically, if you can see benchmarks, so can they! Analyzing Benchmarks Expand | Collapse Chart Types After showing benchmarks, click Chart Type above a benchmarkable question to choose your preferred chart type. A horizontal or vertical bar chart that gives you a side-by-side comparison of your results for each answer choice against the results for each answer choice in the benchmark. A box plot of the weighted average for a particular question against the quartiles of benchmark. A gauge chart specific to the NPS question that compares your NPS against the NPS and quartiles of the benchmark. A skinny donut chart specific to the Top 2 Box Score. A horizontal or vertical bar chart specific to the Top 2 Box Score. Using Quartiles to See Where You Stand The box-and-whiskers plot and the gauge chart display quartiles of the benchmark. Knowing which quartiles you fall between allows you to better understand where you stand in comparison to the organizations included in the benchmark. Quartile Description Minimum The lowest score in the benchmark. Lower Quartile 75% of organizations have scores that are higher than this number Median 50% of organizations have scores that are higher than this number Upper Quartile 25% of organizations have scores that are higher than this number Maximum The highest score in the benchmark If your score falls between the lower quartile and the median , it's in the bottom 25-50% of all organizations in the benchmark. If your score falls between the median and the upper quartile , it's in the top 50-75% of all organizations in the benchmark. If your score falls between the upper quartile and the maximum , it's in the top 25% of all organizations in the benchmark. Top 2 Box Score Top 2 Box Score is the percentage of respondents who selected one of the top two answer options for a question. For any eligible question, you'll see the percentage of your respondents who chose the top two answers compared to the percentage of respondents in the benchmark who chose the top two answers—so you can easily benchmark yourself against leaders in your industry. To use Top 2 Box Score: Show benchmarks. In the upper-right corner of the question, click Chart Type . Choose one of the Top 2 Box Score charts. Click Save . The Top 2 Box Score is only available for benchmarkable, Likert Scale questions, and benchmarks must be turned on to use it. Applying a Compare Rule If you add a Compare Rule to your survey results, you can compare different response groups to the benchmark. For example, let's say you want to compare customer feedback about two different store locations. Add a Multiple Choice question to your survey asking respondents to select the store location they visited. Apply a Compare Rule to that question. Browse the benchmarkable questions in your survey—you'll see a side-by-side view of the results from those two stores and the benchmark. Exporting Benchmark Data If you have a paid Industry Benchmark, you can export a CSV of raw benchmark data. To export a CSV: Select Benchmarks from the toolbar. Click the three dots to the right of a benchmark in the left sidebar and Download CSV . Analyze Tools Restrictions When benchmarks are turned on, some analyze features may behave differently: Benchmark data and charts are not included in exports of your survey results, shared data pages, or Data Trends. If you add a Filter rule, only your survey data is filtered—the benchmark data is not filtered. If you save a View with benchmarks turned on, the Filter or Show rules applied are saved as normal. Benchmark visibility is controlled by the button directly above the question chart and is not dependent on the View applied. Hiding all benchmarks allows you full access to your analyze tools. Why can't I see benchmarks? In the following cases, you might not be able to view benchmarks or you may see a display warning: If you're part of a team , you can view benchmarks on surveys shared with you , as long as the survey owner can view benchmarks (you don't have to complete your profile or opt in). If you're the survey owner, you can't show benchmarks if you've opted out of benchmarks or if you haven't completed your profile. You won't be able to see a benchmark if you changed the question type or edited the number of answer options for the question. You can still see a benchmark if you edited the question text. However, your comparisons might not be valid for benchmarks since your questions may have been interpreted differently by your respondents than by others who saw the questions as they were originally written. To preserve anonymity and to provide accurate comparisons, we have requirements on how much benchmark data we need in order to display benchmarks for a particular question. We're working hard to make sure that we have coverage in all of the questions we offer benchmarking. You can hide the benchmark for that question to see your results instead.

Embedding Your Survey or Form on a Website | SurveyMonkey Help,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/website-collector/,"Embedding Your Survey or Form on a Website | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Overview Creating a Website Collector Style and Behavior Settings Collector Options Embed Tips Help Sending Surveys More Ways to Send Embedding Your Survey or Form on a Website SurveyMonkey Embedding Your Survey or Form on a Website Overview Creating a Website Collector Style and Behavior Settings Collector Options Embed Tips Overview Use a website collector to embed a survey or a button that opens a survey on your website, or popup a survey or invitation. To add one, you only need a basic understanding of HTML and access to your website’s source code. We’ll give you an embed code you can copy and paste. You can embed a survey on multiple pages of your site, if you want. Website Collector Types Type Description Embedded survey Embed your survey on any page of your site so people can take it right there. Embedded button Beta feature : Embed a button on your website that launches your survey when selected. The button continues to display on your site even after someone took the survey. Popup invitation Show a survey invitation in a popup window that links people to your survey. The survey opens in a new browser tab. Popup survey Show your survey in a popup window when people visit a page, without needing to embed the survey in the page layout. Modal Windows Popup Invitations and Popup Surveys show in modal windows that float above your webpage. Modal windows don't require your site visitors to load a new page, and they aren't affected by popup blockers. Cookies We use cookies to stop popups or embedded surveys from reshowing if someone already answered, declined, or closed the survey. If someone clears their cookies, visits your site using a browser that blocks or disables cookies, or the website is opened in a new browser session, the collector can’t remember whether they’ve taken the survey or declined it, so the popup may appear again allowing additional responses. Closing Your Survey When you close your survey , it continues to display on your website, unless you remove the embed code from your site. Creating a Website Collector To create a Website collector: Go to the Collect Response section of your survey. Choose Embed on a site . If you already have a collector for your survey, select Website collector . Choose a website collector type . Scroll down to edit the the style and behavior settings, and adjust the collector options. View the preview to know what your survey will look like on your website. Click Copy Code to copy and paste the embed code onto a page in your site. When embedding a survey or button , paste the script into your HTML wherever you want the survey to appear on your page. When showing a Popup invitation or Popup survey , paste the script into your HTML immediately before your closing </body> tag. The code only needs to be added once. You don’t need to update the Embed code if you make changes to your survey or collector—your updates will display as soon as you refresh the page. Style and Behavior Settings The live survey preview updates as you customize your style and behavior settings for your survey. Settings vary by website type . Setting Description Width and Height Specify how many pixels wide or tall you want the survey to be. When using the Embedded survey type, turn on the Custom size toggle to access these settings. If you leave the toggle off, your survey will match the width of the HTML element containing your survey or form. SurveyMonkey branding You may see a toggle or checkbox which controls whether ""powered by SurveyMonkey"" displays on the bottom border of your survey. If you remove the SurveyMonkey branding, you may also want to remove SurveyMonkey branding from the survey itself. Border or Footer Edit the border color of the window or footer to help your invitation or survey stand out. Invitation or Survey headline Catch your visitor’s attention with a headline that’s no more than 2 lines. You can edit the text, but not the font, size, or color. Invitation message Explain the goal of the survey in 1 – 3 short sentences. You can edit the text, but not the font, size, or color. Primary button This Popup invitation button opens your survey. You can edit the button text, button color, and button text color. Secondary button This Popup invitation button closes the invitation window. You can edit the button text, button color, and button text color. Sample Rate Choose the percentage of visitors to see your Popup invitation or popup survey. Embed button The button embedded on your page that opens your window. You can edit the button label, color, and text color. Popup label This is the text introducing your popup survey. Behavior Choose whether to show the popup immediately, after a delay (measured in seconds), after the visitor scrolls a specific percentage down the page, or when they’re about to leave your page. Collector Options Update the collector options , which are called Settings on the Embedded button type, to customize the survey experience. Some collector options are limited on certain website collector types: Embedded surveys don't have a Survey end page option. Instant results aren't available on any website collector type. The Custom thank you includes SurveyMonkey branding at the end of an Embedded survey, even if you chose to Hide SurveyMonkey Branding . Embed Tips Please don’t edit the Embed code! The Embed code contains several lines of JavaScript and a unique ID that's tied to both your collector and your survey. You can paste the embed code on a single or multiple pages by pasting the embed code before the </body> tag. If you want all pages of your site to display the survey, button, or invitation, paste the embed code before the </header> tag. If you use templates to dynamically generate pages for your site (if you’re using Ruby, Python, PHP, ASP, or a similar technology), you can paste the Embed code snippet into its own file, then include it in your page layout. If you’re using wordpress.org, you need to be an administrator to add the code, or a super admin for multi-site wordpress.org networks. Website collectors aren’t compatible with wordpress.com.

Making Responses Anonymous | SurveyMonkey Help,https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/anonymous-responses/,"Making Responses Anonymous | SurveyMonkey Help Log in SurveyMonkey In this article Tips for Anonymous Surveys Web Links Email Invitations Other Collector Types Respondent Authentication Collectors Created by Integrations Help Sending Surveys Tracking & Anonymity Making Responses Anonymous SurveyMonkey Making Responses Anonymous Tips for Anonymous Surveys Web Links Email Invitations Other Collector Types Respondent Authentication Collectors Created by Integrations The Anonymous Responses collector option lets you choose whether or not to track and store identifiable respondent information in survey results. SurveyMonkey records respondent IP addresses in backend logs and deletes them after 13 months. Tips for Anonymous Surveys If you’re using multiple collectors, you need to turn on Anonymous Responses in each collector. If you want your survey to be anonymous, don’t include identifiable questions in your survey design and don’t use identifiable custom data or custom variables when sending your survey. If you have an Enterprise plan , Primary Admins can choose a default Anonymous Responses setting for their entire team. If you need your survey responses to be anonymous, turn on the Anonymous Responses setting before you send your survey. While you can edit anonymous responses after sending the survey, it’s not possible to make existing responses anonymous. Changing the setting only applies to new responses. Web Links Web Links record the IP addresses of respondents by default. To turn on Anonymous Responses: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector. Click Anonymous Responses and choose On . Email Invitations Email Invitations are designed to help you track respondents, so your survey results will include the email address and IP address of each respondent by default. Additionally, the first name, last name, and custom data about your contacts is tracked, if you included this information in the collector. To turn on Anonymous Responses: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector. Go to the collector options . If you've already sent an invitation, go to the Options tab. When sending your first invitation message in the collector, you'll choose collector options after composing your message. Click Anonymous Responses . Choose to exclude all respondent information to exclude first name, last name, email address, IP address, and custom data from your results. Or choose only exclude personal information to exclude first name, last name, email address, and IP address from your results. TIP! Even if Anonymous Responses is turned on, you can still track email invitations . This info is tied to the email invitation, not to survey results. Other Collector Types By default, most collectors record the IP addresses of respondents in survey results. You can turn on Anonymous Responses to prevent IP tracking. To turn on Anonymous Responses: Go to the collector options for your collector Turn on Make Anonymous or turn off Save IP Address in Results? Respondent Authentication When Respondent Authentication is turned on, the survey is never anonymous because the survey taker’s SSO profile information is tracked. Collectors Created by Integrations Some integrations automatically create collectors in SurveyMonkey, like the Microsoft Teams integration . Whether a survey is anonymous or not is dependent on the integration's settings rather than the Anonymous Responses collector option.

Use respondents to ask about the total number of individuals. Use responses If you want the number of votes or choices. Use terms and concepts from your survey. This helps Analyze with AI understand what data to find and analyze for you. For example, if your survey is about a specific product or industry, ask questions that include the product or industry in your survey. Be specific. Clearly define what specific aspect of the data you are inquiring about. Example : Don’t ask what the “best product” is. Instead, you can ask, “Which product has the highest satisfaction level?"" Avoid general questions. Instead, target specific questions, metrics, or trends. Example : If you’re asking about NPS scores, don’t ask, “How much positive feedback did we get?” Instead, ask about the percentage of promoters. Use clear and direct language. Avoid jargon or overly complex terms unless they are directly relevant to your survey. Quantify when possible. Ask for numbers or percentages to get more specific results. Example : ""What percentage of respondents were very satisfied with the product quality?"" Ask for comparative analysis If you’re interested in trends, comparisons, or changes, specify the exact parameters you want compared. Example: ""Compare the satisfaction levels between different age groups."" Focus on actionable insights. Ask for actionable insights or recommendations. Example: ""Based on the survey responses, what areas should we focus on to improve customer satisfaction?"" Consider data breakdown Specify if you need a breakdown of responses by certain demographics or categories. Example: ""What are the satisfaction levels by geographic region?"" Seek clarifications on anomalies If you notice any unusual patterns or outliers in your data, ask for clarifications or deeper analysis. Example: ""Why might there be a higher dissatisfaction rate among customers aged 18-24?"" Ask a different question when you get the wrong result. If Analyze with AI doesn’t answer your question with the right information, ask again in a different way. Use the thumbs up and thumbs down to rate the responses so we can improve Analyze with AI.

You can send or post your survey anywhere you want—like on social media, in an email (using your own email client), or print it on a newsletter. By default, your survey URL will look something like this, with a string of letters and numbers at the end: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/P58B9BX TIP! Download a QR code for your survey to print on pamphlets, flyers, or posters. Video Overview Creating a Web Link To create a Web Link: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Choose Send surveys your way and then Share a survey link . If you already have a collector created and don't see that option, click Add New Collector and select Web link collector . Choose your collector options . (Optional) Click Customize to use a custom URL ending or change the domain . (Optional) Edit the nickname of the collector by clicking the pencil icon—this nickname does not show to survey takers. Copy the survey link and paste it wherever you'd like. The link works as long as the collector is open —Web link collectors are open by default. Beta Experienc e: Some customers may see a Web link automatically created when they initially go to the Collect Responses section. To create a web link: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. A URL is automatically created for you under Share a link. If you already created another collector or don't see a Web link URL ready for you to use, you can click Share a link to create a new Web link. Choose your collector options . (Optional) Click Link settings to: Use a custom URL ending Change the domain Edit the nickname of the collector by clicking the pencil icon—this nickname does not show to respondents, Under Share a link , click Copy and paste it wherever you'd like. The link works as long as the collector is open —Web link collectors are open by default. Web Links are Public Links Your Web link collector URL is a public link, meaning that anyone who has it will be able to access your survey and complete it. Web crawlers can also access public links, but they won't index your survey on a search engine. Tip! If you wish to use a Web link collector but do not want the link to be public, consider password-protecting your survey . Collector Options It isn't possible to transfer or reuse a SurveyMonkey generated URL ending. Depending on your plan, you can create a Custom URL Ending or use the White Label URL to remove SurveyMonkey branding from your web link. If you customize the URL after you send the survey out, both the old link and the new link will work. You can’t create a Custom URL Ending if you have the Recurrence collector option turned on. Tracking Respondents If you want to track respondents, choose the tracking method you want to use before sending your survey. By default, Web link collectors record IP addresses . However, this information can't really help you track respondents. Instead, you can add required questions to your survey to collect identifying information from respondents, or you can use Custom Variables . Or, you can use an Email invitation instead of a Web link to track respondents. Create a Copy of a Web Link Copying a web link creates a new link for you to share a previous survey at a different time or with new respondents. To create a copy of a Web Link collector: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click ... next to the Web link collector you want to copy. Select Copy Collector .

Survey creators sometimes add trap questions (or red herring questions) to their surveys to ensure respondents are thoroughly reading the survey questions and not rushing through the survey or satisficing. Adding one or two trap questions allows you to filter out respondents who don't correctly answer the trap question. To do this, filter your survey results by question and answer and only show responses from respondents who chose the correct answer choice. Examples A common trap question is a Multiple Choice question where you ask respondents to select a particular answer choice. Please select B as your answer choice.

We've tested the quality of SurveyMonkey Audience responses by sending the same survey through SurveyMonkey Audience and several other online panel providers. The validity rate for SurveyMonkey Audience was higher in comparison to other panel providers.
